Members provided detailed UX/UI feedback including concerns about red/green color scheme conflicting with Yes/No semantics, suggestions for smoother parlay selection flow (single tap vs two-tap), reducing overwhelming number of visible options (16 down to 4-8), and onboarding improvements. Also discussion about CFTC compliance - navigating DCM/FCM licensing and looking for FCM partners. Social question about where to find biltong in SF.",

If you create an event contract you need to become a Designated Contract Maker (DCM) under the CFTC which is tough to get took Kalshi 3 years + millions of $ and polymarket had to make an acquisition to get it. If you route these event contacts to new users but still hedge/clear on the underlying DCM you're seen as a Futures Commission Merchant (FCM) which isn't as bad to get the license for. The quickest way to get regulated seems to be to partner with a FCM to clear on the DCM and to get an Introducing Broker (IB) license"
