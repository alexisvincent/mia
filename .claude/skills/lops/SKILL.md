# LOPS System

**LOPS** (LEX OPS) is a GTD-based productivity system adapted for Linear with AI assistance.

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke this skill when you need to:
- **Triage inbox items** - Process captures and move them into the right lists
- **Prioritize work** - Select what to work on today or this week
- **Capture tasks** - Add new items to your system
- **Run weekly review** - Maintain system health and objective progress
- **Clarify next actions** - Convert vague ideas into clear, actionable tasks
- **Organize work** - Apply correct labels, statuses, and metadata
- **Delegate work** - Assign tasks to team members, contractors, or AI agents

## Core Principle

Your brain is terrible at remembering things at the right time. LOPS offloads everything into a trusted external system, freeing your mind for productive thinking instead of constant tracking.

**Key insight:** Convert vague thoughts into clear, physical, visible actions. This reduces resistance because the "pre-processing" is already done.

## The System

LOPS implements GTD using Linear as the primary tool with progressive prioritization:
- **Triage** → **Backlog** → **This Week** → **Next** → **Done**
