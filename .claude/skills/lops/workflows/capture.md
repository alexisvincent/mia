# Capture Workflow

**Frequency:** Ongoing (whenever something occurs to you)

**Goal:** Get everything out of your head and into the system with minimal friction.

## The Purpose

Capture is about offloading your brain. Every time you think "I need to remember this," capture it immediately instead of trying to hold it mentally. This frees up mental energy for productive thinking rather than mental tracking.

## Core Principle

**The barrier for capturing should be as low as possible.** If it takes too much effort, you won't do it, and things will slip through the cracks.

## What to Capture

Capture ALL **open loops**—anything that isn't as it should be, where it should be, or requires attention:

- Tasks you need to do
- Ideas and random thoughts
- Commitments you made to others
- Concerns or worries
- Information you might need later
- Things you're expecting from others

An **open loop** is anything incomplete or unresolved that's taking up mental space. If it's on your mind, it's an open loop.

**Rule:** If it crosses your mind, capture it. You'll decide what to do with it during triage.

## Capture Channels

LOPS supports multiple capture channels:

### 1. Linear (Direct to Triage)
Create issue directly in Triage status when at computer.

### 2. Physical Notebook
Write things down on paper when away from devices.

### 3. AI Assistant (Claude Code, ChatGPT, Claude)
Speak or type to AI and ask it to save something. AI uses MCP to add directly to Triage.

### 4. Inbox Streams (WhatsApp, iMessage, Email)
Messages in various communication channels where tasks might be mentioned.

### 5. Granola (Meeting Notes)
Action items and tasks mentioned during meetings captured by Granola.

### 6. Apple Notes
Quick notes and captures in Apple Notes app.

**Important:** Multiple capture channels are encouraged. See [Collect Workflow](./triage/collect.md) for how each channel gets consolidated into the Triage queue.

## How to Capture

### Keep It Raw
Don't overthink during capture. Just get it out:

- ✅ "dentist appointment"
- ✅ "something about quarterly taxes"
- ✅ "talk to Sarah about budget"
- ✅ "weird error on homepage"

Don't worry about:
- Making it a perfect next action (that's triage's job)
- Adding labels or context (triage)
- Figuring out what to do about it (triage)

### Speed Over Perfection
Capture should take seconds, not minutes. Write just enough to remember what you meant.

## The Trust Factor

Your brain will only stop tracking things when it trusts that:
1. Everything is being captured
2. Nothing will be forgotten
3. Captured items will be processed

**This means:** Capture EVERYTHING, even small stuff. Your brain needs proof the system works.

## Common Mistakes

❌ Trying to process during capture ("let me think about what to say...")
✅ Just capture: "email John about budget"

❌ Skipping small items ("I'll remember to buy toothpaste")
✅ Capture it anyway

❌ Capturing vague references ("that thing")
✅ Add just enough: "pricing discussion with Michael yesterday"

## Initial Brain Dump

When first starting LOPS, set aside 1-2 hours and write down EVERYTHING you can think of—projects, tasks, ideas, concerns, commitments. Don't organize, just dump. This creates the foundation of trust in your system.

## Next Step

All captured items get pulled together during the [Collect](./triage/collect.md) workflow, where everything from various capture channels is consolidated into the Linear Triage queue before processing begins.

**Note:** In the future, this will be fully automated—captures will automatically appear in Triage. Until then, the Collect workflow at the start of triage sessions handles this manually.
