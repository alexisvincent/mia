# Prioritize Workflow

**Frequency:** Daily (5-10 min) and Weekly (15-20 min as part of Weekly Review)

**Goal:** Select the most important items to work on based on energy, time available, and strategic importance.

## The Purpose

Prioritization is about realistic focus. Not everything can be done today or this week. This workflow helps you make conscious choices about where to invest your limited time and energy.

**Key insight:** With ADHD, energy and cognitive capacity vary throughout the day. Match tasks to your current state for maximum effectiveness.

## Two Levels of Prioritization

LOPS uses progressive prioritization:

1. **Weekly Prioritization:** Backlog → This Week (10-15 items)
2. **Daily Prioritization:** This Week → Next (3-5 items)

---

## Weekly Prioritization (15-20 min)

**When:** During or after Weekly Review (Friday afternoon or Sunday evening)

**Goal:** Select 10-15 items from Backlog for the coming week.

### Weekly Prioritization Checklist

Copy this checklist and check off as you complete:

```
Weekly Planning:
- [ ] Step 1: Review calendar and commitments
- [ ] Step 2: Identify Top Goal work
- [ ] Step 3: Select This Week items
- [ ] Step 4: Balance energy levels
- [ ] Step 5: Reality check
```

### Step 1: Review Calendar and Commitments

- [ ] **Scan your calendar for the coming week:**
  - How many meetings/appointments?
  - Any travel or time off?
  - How many hours of focused work time are actually available?

**Reality check:** If you have 20 hours of meetings, don't plan 30 hours of work.

### Step 2: Identify Top Goal Work (2-Hour Daily Blocks)

- [ ] **What is your Top Goal?** (Most important quarterly priority)
- [ ] **Block 2 hours each workday** for Top Goal work on your calendar
- [ ] **Select or create 1-2 Top Goal actions** to move to This Week

**Rule:** Protect Top Goal time daily. This ensures strategic progress happens.

### Step 3: Select This Week Items from Backlog

Search Linear for items in **Backlog** status and select 8-13 additional items.

**Selection criteria:**

- [ ] **Deadlines:** Any items with actual deadlines this week? (Must do)
- [ ] **Dependencies:** Any items blocking others? (High impact)
- [ ] **Quick wins:** Include some XS/S items for momentum
- [ ] **Important objectives:** What advances your objectives?
- [ ] **Diverse contexts:** Mix @computer, @phone, @outside, @home tasks

**Move selected items to This Week status.**

### Step 4: Balance Energy Levels

Review your This Week selections and check energy balance:

- [ ] **High Energy (🔥):** 3-5 items - Deep work, complex problems, strategic thinking
- [ ] **Medium Energy (⚡):** 5-8 items - Standard tasks, meetings, moderate complexity
- [ ] **Low Energy (🌙):** 2-3 items - Admin work, simple tasks, routine items

**Why balance matters:** You won't have high energy all week. Having low-energy tasks available prevents "stuck" days.

**Note:** See [system.md](../system.md#energy-labels) for details on energy labels.

### Step 5: Reality Check

- [ ] **Total items in This Week:** 10-15 items (including Top Goal work)
- [ ] **Does this feel realistic?** If your gut says "too much," it probably is
- [ ] **Remove lower-priority items** if needed

**Better to succeed with 10 items than fail with 20.**

**Output:** This Week status contains 10-15 realistic, energy-balanced items.

## Daily Prioritization (5-10 min)

**When:** Morning (during daily startup routine) or night before

**Goal:** Select 3-5 items from This Week to work on today.

### Daily Prioritization Checklist

Copy this checklist:

```
Daily Planning:
- [ ] Step 1: Check calendar and available time
- [ ] Step 2: Assess current energy level
- [ ] Step 3: Select 3-5 Next items
- [ ] Step 4: Protect Top Goal time
- [ ] Step 5: Quick reality check
```

### Step 1: Check Calendar and Available Time

- [ ] **Review today's calendar:**
  - Meetings and commitments?
  - Travel or appointments?
  - How many hours of focused work time available?

**Time calculation example:**
- 8-hour workday
- Minus 3 hours of meetings
- Minus 1 hour for email/Slack/breaks
- = 4 hours of focused work time available

### Step 2: Assess Current Energy Level

- [ ] **How's your energy today?**
  - **High energy:** Tackle complex, deep work tasks (🔥)
  - **Medium energy:** Standard tasks and routine work (⚡)
  - **Low energy:** Admin, simple tasks, or defer big items (🌙)

**ADHD tip:** Your energy will vary throughout the day. Match tasks to your current state:
- **Morning (usually highest):** Complex, creative, strategic work
- **Afternoon:** Meetings, routine tasks, admin
- **Evening:** Light tasks, planning, reading

### Step 3: Select 3-5 Next Items

Search Linear for items in **This Week** status.

**Selection criteria:**

- [ ] **Time-sensitive:** Any deadlines today?
- [ ] **Top Goal:** Protect 2-hour block for Top Goal work
- [ ] **Energy match:** Select items matching your current/expected energy
- [ ] **Time fit:** Total estimated time ≤ available focus hours
- [ ] **Context match:** Can you actually do these today? (@home, @computer, etc.)

**Ideal distribution:**
- 1-2 high-impact items (Top Goal or important objectives)
- 2-3 medium items (progress on This Week goals)
- 0-1 quick wins (XS/S tasks for momentum)

**Move selected items to Next status.**

### Step 4: Protect Top Goal Time

- [ ] **Verify 2-hour Top Goal block** is on calendar
- [ ] **Close time:** Ideally morning when energy is highest
- [ ] **Defend it:** No meetings, no email, no Slack during this time

**If you skip this:** You'll get things done but make no strategic progress.

### Step 5: Quick Reality Check

- [ ] **Can I realistically complete these 3-5 items today?**
- [ ] **Did I overcommit?** (Be honest - ADHD brains overestimate capacity)
- [ ] **Remove items if needed** - Better to succeed with 3 than fail with 5

**Output:** Next status contains 3-5 realistic items for today.

## Energy-Aware Decision Making

### Matching Tasks to Energy States

**High Energy (🔥) - Use for:**
- Writing strategy documents
- Complex problem-solving
- Learning new concepts
- Creative work
- Difficult conversations
- Important decisions

**Medium Energy (⚡) - Use for:**
- Routine meetings
- Code reviews
- Email processing
- Standard execution work
- Follow-ups and updates

**Low Energy (🌙) - Use for:**
- Filing and organizing
- Data entry
- Responding to simple messages
- Reading (not deep learning)
- Planning and list-making
- Light administrative tasks

### Your Personal Energy Patterns

Pay attention to YOUR patterns over time:

- [ ] **When is your energy highest?** (Often mornings)
- [ ] **When do you crash?** (Often post-lunch)
- [ ] **What drains energy?** (Context switching, meetings, decision fatigue)
- [ ] **What restores energy?** (Movement, nature, breaks, certain tasks)

**Use this knowledge to schedule accordingly.**

## Top Goal System

### The Problem

Without deliberate focus, urgent tasks consume all time. Weeks pass without progress on important strategic work.

### The Solution

**Schedule 2 hours every workday for your Top Goal only.**

- ❌ No email
- ❌ No texts
- ❌ No calls
- ❌ No messages
- ✅ Only your top quarterly priority

### Implementation

**Start small if 2 hours feels overwhelming:**
- Week 1: 30 minutes daily
- Week 2: 1 hour daily
- Week 3: 1.5 hours daily
- Week 4: 2 hours daily

**Schedule early:** Morning hours have highest energy and fewer interruptions.

**Defend ruthlessly:** This is your most important work.

---

## Common Mistakes

❌ Prioritizing 10 items for "today"
✅ Max 3-5 items for Next (today)

❌ Ignoring energy levels - trying complex work when exhausted
✅ Match tasks to current energy state

❌ Skipping Top Goal time because "too busy"
✅ Protect Top Goal time - this IS the important work

❌ Only choosing urgent items
✅ Balance urgent with important (Top Goal)

❌ Selecting tasks you can't actually do today (wrong context)
✅ Check contexts - can you do @outside tasks if you're home all day?

---

## Success Metrics

**You're prioritizing well when:**

- You complete most/all Next items each day
- You make consistent Top Goal progress (10+ hours/week)
- You finish This Week items by week's end
- You feel in control, not overwhelmed
- Important objectives advance regularly

**Red flags:**

- Regularly completing <50% of Next items (over-committing)
- Top Goal time getting skipped (lack of strategic progress)
- This Week items rolling over multiple weeks (unrealistic planning)

---

## Next Steps

After prioritization:

- **Daily:** Follow [daily-routines.md](./daily-routines.md) for morning startup
- **Weekly:** Return to [review.md](./review.md) to maintain system health
- **During work:** See [guides/writing-next-actions.md](../guides/writing-next-actions.md) for execution guidance
