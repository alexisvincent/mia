# Daily Routines

**Goal:** Consistent, low-friction rituals that reduce decision fatigue and maintain system trust.

## The Purpose

Daily routines create predictability and reduce cognitive load. With ADHD, routines are **critical** for maintaining system consistency without having to think about it.

**Key insight:** Decision fatigue is real. Having standard routines means you don't waste mental energy deciding "what should I do now?"

## The Three Daily Touchpoints

1. **Morning Startup (10 min)** - Set up your day for success
2. **Midday Check-in (5 min)** - Stay on track and adjust
3. **End-of-Day Shutdown (10 min)** - Close loops and prepare for tomorrow

## Morning Startup (10 minutes)

**When:** First thing when you start work (before email, before Slack)

**Goal:** Clear picture of today's priorities and protected time for Top Goal.

### Morning Startup Checklist

Copy this checklist and use daily:

```
Morning Startup:
- [ ] Step 1: Review Next (today's list)
- [ ] Step 2: Check calendar
- [ ] Step 3: Verify Top Goal block
- [ ] Step 4: Quick Waiting For scan
- [ ] Step 5: Start with highest energy task
```

### Step 1: Review Next (Today's List)

Open Linear and view items in **Next** status.

- [ ] **Do these still make sense?** (circumstances may have changed overnight)
- [ ] **Is this realistic?** (3-5 items max)
- [ ] **Remove/adjust if needed**

**If Next is empty:** Run quick daily prioritization from [prioritize.md](./prioritize.md#daily-prioritization-5-10-min).

### Step 2: Check Calendar

- [ ] **Review today's schedule:**
  - Any meetings or commitments?
  - How much focused work time is available?
  - Any prep work needed for meetings?

**Adjust Next list if calendar changed** (emergency meetings added, etc.)

### Step 3: Verify Top Goal Block

- [ ] **Confirm 2-hour Top Goal block** is on calendar
- [ ] **Ideally scheduled for morning** (highest energy time)
- [ ] **No conflicts?** If yes, reschedule block to another time today

**If you skip this:** You'll be reactive all day with no strategic progress.

### Step 4: Quick Waiting For Scan

Search Linear for **Waiting For** status items.

- [ ] **Any responses arrived?** Move to appropriate status
- [ ] **Anything critically overdue?** Add follow-up to Next

**Time limit:** 2 minutes max - full review happens during weekly review.

### Step 5: Start with Highest Energy Task

**Don't start with email.** Don't start with Slack.

- [ ] **Identify highest-energy item on Next list** (usually Top Goal work)
- [ ] **Start working on it immediately**

**Why this matters:** Morning is your highest energy time. Don't waste it on low-value activities.

**Output:** Clear priorities, protected Top Goal time, started on highest-value work.

## Midday Check-in (5 minutes)

**When:** Around lunch time or mid-afternoon

**Goal:** Stay on track, adjust if needed, maintain momentum.

### Midday Check-in Checklist

```
Midday Check:
- [ ] Step 1: Update completed items
- [ ] Step 2: Energy assessment
- [ ] Step 3: Adjust afternoon plan
```

### Step 1: Update Completed Items

- [ ] **Mark done items as Done** in Linear
- [ ] **Celebrate progress** (even small wins count!)

### Step 2: Energy Assessment

- [ ] **How's your energy right now?**
  - High: Continue with complex work
  - Medium: Switch to standard tasks
  - Low: Switch to admin/simple tasks

**Don't fight your energy state.** If you're exhausted, don't force complex work. Switch to low-energy tasks on your Next list.

### Step 3: Adjust Afternoon Plan

Based on morning progress and current energy:

- [ ] **Will you complete everything on Next?** If no, reprioritize
- [ ] **Need to switch task types?** Match tasks to current energy
- [ ] **Any urgent items emerged?** Add to Next if truly urgent

**Output:** Realistic afternoon plan aligned with current energy.

## End-of-Day Shutdown (10 minutes)

**When:** Last 10 minutes of workday (set recurring daily reminder)

**Goal:** Close all loops, capture anything remaining, prepare for tomorrow.

### End-of-Day Shutdown Checklist

```
Shutdown Routine:
- [ ] Step 1: Mark completed items Done
- [ ] Step 2: Process Next list
- [ ] Step 3: Capture open loops
- [ ] Step 4: Quick tomorrow preview
- [ ] Step 5: Close everything
```

### Step 1: Mark Completed Items Done

- [ ] **All done items marked as Done?**
- [ ] **Any partial progress to note?** Add comments to issues

### Step 2: Process Next List

For any items still in **Next** status:

- [ ] **Why didn't it get done?**
  - Unrealistic? Move to This Week
  - Blocked? Move to Waiting For (note blocker)
  - Lost priority? Move to Backlog
  - Still relevant tomorrow? Can stay in Next

**Goal:** Next should reflect reality, not fantasy.

### Step 3: Capture Open Loops

**Brain dump anything on your mind:**

- [ ] Tasks you thought of but didn't capture
- [ ] Commitments you made during meetings
- [ ] Ideas that came up
- [ ] Things you're worried about

**Add all captures to Triage** - you'll process during triage session.

**This step is critical:** It tells your brain it can stop tracking these things.

### Step 4: Quick Tomorrow Preview

- [ ] **Check tomorrow's calendar** - any early meetings or prep needed?
- [ ] **Leave 3-5 items in Next** for tomorrow (or plan to prioritize in morning)
- [ ] **Note anything time-sensitive** for tomorrow

**Optional:** Do full daily prioritization now if you prefer planning night before.

### Step 5: Close Everything

- [ ] **Close all work tabs/windows**
- [ ] **Close Slack/email**
- [ ] **Close Linear**
- [ ] **Physically step away** from workspace

**This ritual signals:** Work day is done. Brain can disengage.

**Output:** All loops closed, tomorrow previewed, workspace cleared, ready to disconnect.

## Building the Habit

### Start Small

Don't try to implement all three routines perfectly on day one.

**Week 1:** Just morning startup (10 min)
**Week 2:** Add end-of-day shutdown (10 min)
**Week 3:** Add midday check-in (5 min)

**Make it routine:** Same time, same place, same order every day.

### Use Triggers

**Morning startup trigger:** Opening your computer / first coffee
**Midday check-in trigger:** Lunch time / calendar reminder
**End-of-day shutdown trigger:** Calendar reminder 10 min before end of day

### Make It Easy

**Reduce friction:**
- [ ] Bookmark Linear views you need (Next, Waiting For, etc.)
- [ ] Create calendar reminders for routines
- [ ] Keep checklists accessible (bookmark this page)
- [ ] Set up saved Linear filters for quick access

### Track Consistency

**Simple metric:** Did you do the routine? Yes/No

Track for 30 days. Aim for 80%+ consistency (not 100% - life happens).

**After 30 days:** These routines become automatic.

## Common Obstacles

### "I Don't Have Time"

**Reality check:** These routines SAVE time by preventing:
- Forgetting important tasks
- Working on wrong priorities
- Context switching chaos
- Mental tracking overhead

**Total time investment:** 25 minutes/day to save hours of confusion and rework.

### "I Forget to Do Them"

**Solutions:**
- Set calendar reminders (recurring)
- Link to existing habits (coffee = startup routine)
- Put sticky note on monitor
- Ask AI assistant to remind you

### "I Keep Skipping Shutdown"

**This is the most commonly skipped routine.**

**Solutions:**
- Set hard stop time (calendar reminder with alarm)
- Pair with something pleasant (end of shutdown = start evening activity)
- Remember: Skipping shutdown = less trust in system = more mental overhead

**Tip:** If truly can't do 10 min, do 5-minute version:
1. Mark done items (1 min)
2. Brain dump open loops (2 min)
3. Check tomorrow's calendar (1 min)
4. Close everything (1 min)

## ADHD-Specific Tips

### Use External Reminders

Your brain won't remember. That's OK. Use:
- Calendar alerts with sound
- Phone alarms
- Visual cues (sticky notes)
- AI assistant prompts

### Keep Checklists Visible

Don't rely on memory. Keep routines visible:
- Bookmark this page
- Print checklists and stick to monitor
- Save in note-taking app
- Use Linear saved views

### Build Streaks Slowly

Don't expect perfection. Celebrate:
- 1 week of morning startups
- 3 days in a row of all routines
- First week of consistent shutdowns

**Progress, not perfection.**

### Recovery Protocol

**When you skip routines for days/weeks:**

Don't panic. Just restart:
1. Run weekly review to reset system
2. Start with just morning startup
3. Rebuild habits gradually

**The system forgives inconsistency.** Just get back to it.

## Success Metrics

**You know routines are working when:**

- You start work knowing exactly what to do (no decision paralysis)
- You feel in control during the day
- You can disconnect at end of day (brain stops working)
- Your Next list reflects reality
- You trust your system to remember things

**Red flags:**

- Constant surprises ("forgot about that meeting!")
- Working late because "just remembered" things
- Sunday anxiety about upcoming week
- Feeling like you're forgetting important tasks
