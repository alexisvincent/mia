# Weekly Review Workflow

**Frequency:** Weekly (60 minutes, Friday afternoon or Sunday evening recommended)

**Goal:** Maintain system health, ensure all objectives have next actions, surface missed commitments, and realign work with goals.

## The Purpose

The Weekly Review is the **most critical** practice in LOPS. This is what keeps your system trustworthy and prevents it from becoming a graveyard of outdated tasks.

Without the Weekly Review, your system dies. With it, you maintain complete trust in your system.

**Schedule it:** Block 60 minutes at the same time every week. Make it as routine as brushing your teeth.

## The Weekly Review Checklist

Copy this checklist and check off items as you complete them:

```
Weekly Review Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Get Clear (Process all inboxes)
- [ ] Step 2: Get Current (Update all lists)
- [ ] Step 3: Get Creative (Look ahead and align)
- [ ] Step 4: Capture Missed Items (Trigger list)
- [ ] Step 5: System Health Check
```

---

## Step 1: Get Clear (15 min)

**Goal:** Ensure all inboxes are empty and processed.

### Process All Capture Points

Go through each capture channel and ensure everything is in Linear:

- [ ] **Triage queue** - Should be empty (run triage if needed)
- [ ] **Email inboxes** - Process to zero or capture any tasks
- [ ] **Physical notebooks** - Transfer any uncaptured items
- [ ] **WhatsApp/iMessage** - Scan for uncaptured tasks
- [ ] **Meeting notes (Granola)** - Extract action items
- [ ] **Apple Notes** - Review and process

**Output:** All capture points empty, everything in Linear.

---

## Step 2: Get Current (25 min)

**Goal:** Update all lists to reflect reality.

### Review Objectives (Projects)

Search Linear for all items with the **objective** label.

For each objective, ask:

- [ ] **Does this still matter?** If not, cancel it
- [ ] **Is it blocked?** If yes, create unblocking action or move to Someday/Maybe
- [ ] **Does it have at least one next action in Backlog/This Week/Next?**
  - If NO: Either create the next action or move to Someday/Maybe
  - If it's stalled and you don't know the next action, that's a signal it needs thinking time

**Critical Rule:** Every active objective MUST have at least one next action. If you can't define a next action, the objective goes to Someday/Maybe until you can.

### Review This Week

Search Linear for all items in **This Week** status.

- [ ] **Mark completed items as Done** - Anything finished but not marked
- [ ] **Review incomplete items:**
  - Still relevant for this coming week? Keep in This Week
  - No longer urgent? Move to Backlog
  - No longer needed? Cancel it
  - Waiting on someone? Move to Waiting For with date/person

**Output:** This Week list only contains items you realistically will work on this coming week.

### Review Next (Today)

Search Linear for all items in **Next** status.

- [ ] **Complete or move incomplete items:**
  - If it didn't get done today, was it unrealistic? Move to This Week or Backlog
  - If it's still relevant for tomorrow, can keep in Next
  - If blocked, move to Waiting For

**Output:** Next list is clear for tomorrow's prioritization.

### Review Backlog

Scan your **Backlog** (don't read every item, just scan):

- [ ] **Remove stale items:**
  - Still relevant? Keep it
  - No longer matters? Cancel or move to Someday/Maybe
  - Became more urgent? Note for This Week planning

**Output:** Backlog contains only items you genuinely intend to do "someday soon."

### Review Someday/Maybe

Scan **Someday/Maybe** list:

- [ ] **Activate ready items:** Anything that's now relevant? Move to Backlog
- [ ] **Prune dead ideas:** Delete items you'll never do
- [ ] **Incubate future items:** Keep items that aren't ready but might be someday

**Output:** Someday/Maybe is a clean list of genuine future possibilities.

### Review Waiting For

Search Linear for all items in **Waiting For** status.

- [ ] **Check for aging items:**
  - Anything >1 week old? Consider following up
  - Anything >2 weeks old? Definitely follow up or move back to Backlog to do yourself
  - Add follow-up actions to Backlog if needed

**Output:** Clear tracking of all delegated work with follow-up actions where needed.

### Review Agenda Lists

Search for all items with **agenda-** labels.

- [ ] **Prepare for upcoming meetings:**
  - Review items tagged for each person/meeting
  - Add any new discussion items you've thought of
  - Remove items that are no longer relevant

**Output:** Ready for all regular meetings with batched discussion items.

---

## Step 3: Get Creative (10 min)

**Goal:** Look ahead and align work with bigger goals.

### Review Calendar

- [ ] **Scan next 2 weeks:**
  - Any prep work needed for upcoming events?
  - Any travel or time off that affects This Week planning?
  - Create actions for any prep needed

### Align with Goals

- [ ] **Review quarterly OKRs/goals** (if you have them):
  - Am I making progress on my Top Goal?
  - Do I have This Week items that advance my goals?
  - Are there objectives or actions I should create?

### Capture New Ideas

- [ ] **Brain dump any new ideas:**
  - Things you've been thinking about but haven't captured
  - Projects you want to start
  - Add to Triage for processing

---

## Step 4: Capture Missed Items (5 min)

**Goal:** Use trigger list to surface forgotten commitments.

Go through this trigger list and capture anything that comes to mind:

### People Triggers
- [ ] Boss/manager - any commitments or updates needed?
- [ ] Direct reports - anything you promised?
- [ ] Colleagues - any pending collaborations?
- [ ] Family/friends - any commitments?
- [ ] Contractors/vendors - anything outstanding?

### Work Triggers
- [ ] Projects started but not completed
- [ ] Projects that need to be started
- [ ] People you need to get back to
- [ ] Financial items (expenses, invoices, taxes)
- [ ] Personal/home items needing attention

**Output:** Any missed items captured in Triage for processing.

---

## Step 5: System Health Check (5 min)

**Goal:** Verify system is healthy and trustworthy.

### Metrics Check

Quick pulse check on system health:

- [ ] **Triage processing:** Is Triage empty or near-empty?
- [ ] **Objective coverage:** Do all objectives have next actions?
- [ ] **This Week realism:** Does This Week list feel realistic?
- [ ] **Trust level:** Do I trust my system? If not, what's wrong?

### Continuous Improvement

- [ ] **What worked this week?** Note any wins
- [ ] **What didn't work?** Identify friction points
- [ ] **System adjustments needed?** Any labels, workflows, or tools to change?
