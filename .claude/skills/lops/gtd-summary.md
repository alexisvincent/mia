# GTD Summary

Getting Things Done (GTD) is a productivity methodology created by David Allen designed to create 100% trust in a system for collecting tasks, ideas, and projects. The core insight is that your brain is terrible at remembering things at the right time—instead of reminding you when you bike past the watch store, it creates an incessant feeling of "I need to remember... something."

## The Core Philosophy

**Offload your brain.** When your system and trust in your system are in place, your subconsciousness stops keeping track of what you need to do and stops constantly reminding you. This reduces stress and frees up mental energy for productive thinking.

GTD works by converting both tasks and whims into **physical** and **visible** actions, maintained in lists that every kid with paper and a pencil can manage.

## The Five Core Lists

### 1. In (Inbox)

**Purpose:** Capture ideas and tasks as they occur to you.

**Key Principles:**
- The barrier for adding items should be as low as possible
- Capture everything—all "open loops" that aren't as they should be, where they should be
- Multiple inboxes are fine (app, notebook, email, Slack, text, etc.)

**Processing Rule:** Process every single item in your inbox each day

### 2. Next Actions

**Purpose:** The list of "as-soon-as-possible actions" you'll pick from when you have time.

**Critical Rule:** Next actions must be the next **physical, visible** action needed. Not "plan cake lottery" but "email Arthur and Camille to remind them to bake their cakes."

**The Two-Minute Rule:** If an action takes <2 minutes to complete, do it immediately. If not, write down the required action and add it to the appropriate list.

**Context Organization:** Separate next actions into contexts—tags that say where the action can be done or what equipment you need:
- **@Computer** - Requires computer access
- **@Calls** - Phone calls you can make anywhere
- **@Outside** - Errands that require going out
- **@Home** - Actions only possible at home
- **@Everywhere** - Can be done anywhere (e.g., "Call mum")

**Example Actions:**

**Computer:**
- Write first draft of 10-year Company Vision
- Browse competitor documentation

**Calls:**
- John 650-555-3452 schedule company offsite
- Mary 415-555-1234 review draft financing docs

**Outside:**
- Walgreens - pick up prescription

**Sharp Edges:** Tasks should be written as **single actions** (not broad goals), so clearly that you don't need to think about what needs to be done when you read it next.

### 3. Waiting For

**Purpose:** Track work you've delegated or are waiting on from others.

**Format:** List the person, the requested action, and **the date you made the request**.

**Usage:** Scan this list to identify aging requests. Move outstanding items back to Next Actions to follow up.

**Examples:**
- Sarah - feedback on Sales Playbook, 3-18
- Jim - Write-up issue for next Leadership Team Meeting, 3-19
- Bill - time to meet, 3-19

### 4. Projects

**Definition:** Any objective requiring more than one action to complete.

**Purpose:** Ensure multi-step work doesn't get forgotten after completing the first action.

**Contents:** Project titles, descriptions, and intended outcomes.

**Review Rule:** When reviewing your Projects list, ensure there's always at least one action on your Next Actions list for each project.

### 5. Someday/Maybe

**Purpose:** Capture ideas and projects you might want to realize someday, but not right now.

**Examples:**
- Replace ugly painting in bedroom
- Schedule a guitar lesson
- Start learning Indonesian
- Order book: Getting Things Done by David Allen

**Review:** Examined weekly to see if any items should move to Projects or Next Actions.

## Additional Lists (Enhancements)

### 6. Agenda

**Problem:** Inefficient people waste time on one-off issues in real-time.

**Solution:** Batch issues and discuss them all at once during regular meetings.

**How to Use:**
- Create an Agenda list for each person/meeting you have regularly
- When you think of something to discuss, write it on their Agenda list
- During the meeting, review everything accumulated there

**Examples:**

**Spouse:**
- What should we do for our winter holiday?
- Connect - listen to each other's day for 10 minutes each

**Leadership Team:**
- Are we having enough fun?
- 10-year Company Vision
- 3-month Company Roadmap

### 7. Goals (Optional)

**Not part of Allen's GTD**, but many find it helpful.

**Contents:**
- 10 Year Vision
- Quarterly OKRs
- Department/Team/Individual OKRs

**Usage:** Refer to regularly to flesh out your Next Action list.

## The Processing Workflow

When processing items from your **In** list, follow this decision tree:

1. **Is it actionable?**
   - **NO:**
     - Trash it (no longer needed)
     - Reference material (might need later)
     - Someday/Maybe (not actionable now)
     - Incubate (calendar/tickler file for future reminder)
   - **YES:** Continue to step 2

2. **What is the next action?** (Must be physical and visible)

3. **Can it be done in <2 minutes?**
   - **YES:** Do it now
   - **NO:** Continue to step 4

4. **Should I delegate it?**
   - **YES:** Delegate and add to Waiting For list (with date)
   - **NO:** Add to Next Actions list

5. **Does it require multiple actions?**
   - **YES:** Also add to Projects list

## Calendar Usage

**CRITICAL RULE:** The calendar is for things you **HAVE** to do on a certain date or time—and **nothing else**!

**Why?** By only having time/date-sensitive items on your calendar, it actually tells you what you must do that day without being diluted. Things you want to do (but that aren't time-sensitive) go on Next Actions.

## Review Schedule

### Daily Review
- **Next Actions** - What to work on today
- **Waiting For** - Check on aging requests

### Weekly Review
**Critical for success.** Set aside at least 30 minutes (Friday or Sunday afternoons work well).

**Weekly Review Checklist:**
- ✅ Ensure each project has at least one next action
- ✅ Review Next Actions list—remove or move items you won't actually do this week
- ✅ Review Someday/Maybe—move items to Projects/Next Actions if ready
- ✅ Work through trigger list to capture any missed open loops
- ✅ Review Agenda lists
- ✅ Review Projects list

**Trigger List:** Key words to "trigger" your brain to remember open loops:
- Boss
- Co-workers
- Projects started, not completed
- Projects that need to be started
- People I need to get back to

## Inbox Zero Method

**Metaphor:** Your inbox is a **triage room** at a hospital, not a waiting room.

**Why It Matters:** If you mix functions (triage + waiting), urgent cases can "bleed out" before you notice them. You must keep the triage room absolutely clear.

**The Batching Strategy:**
- ❌ Don't check email incessantly (wastes hours)
- ✅ Check only twice daily (morning and afternoon)
- ✅ Process completely to Inbox Zero each time

**Process:**
1. Two-minute rule: If <2 min, do it immediately
2. If >2 min, write Next Action and move email to appropriate location:
   - Next Action
   - Waiting For
   - Someday/Maybe
   - Reference
3. Repeat until Inbox Zero

**Bold Claim:** You can achieve Inbox Zero within an hour, even with thousands of emails.

## Top Goal System (Enhancement)

**The CEO's Dilemma:** Infinite daily tasks, yet weeks pass without accomplishing anything important.

**Solution:** Schedule **2 hours each day** to work on your Top Goal only. Do this every single workday.

**Rules During Top Goal Time:**
- ❌ No email
- ❌ No texts
- ❌ No calls
- ❌ No messages
- ✅ Only your top quarterly priority

**Implementation:**
- Schedule early in the day (fresh brain, fewer interruptions)
- Start with 30 minutes if 2 hours feels overwhelming
- Increase weekly: 30 min → 1 hour → 1.5 hours → 2 hours

**Brain Science:** Decision and thought-processing energy is highest early in the day. Take advantage of high-quality brain functioning by doing important work first.

## Supporting Tools

### Read/Review Folder

A folder (physical or digital) containing documents you want to read. Keep it available for windows of free time (dentist's waiting room, café, etc.).

**Sharp Edges:** Only include things you'll actually read when you have time.

### Tickler File

43 physical file folders: 31 for days of the month + 12 for months of the year.

**Usage:**
- Place physical items needed on specific days (concert tickets)
- Reminders of things to possibly do on specific dates
- Items to review later (lecture notes you didn't understand)
- Each day, open current date folder, process contents, move folder to back
- End of month, open new month's folder and distribute items to day folders

**Purpose:** Send yourself reminders in the future—"tickling" your memory.

## Best Practices

1. **Hard Edges:** Clear boundaries between lists. If you often wonder which context a next action belongs to, reconsider your contexts.

2. **Tools Should Be Fun—But Not Too Fun:**
   - Too slow/complicated → subconscious resistance to capturing tasks
   - Too fun → over-use and playing with features
   - Find what works for you

3. **Physical and Visible Actions:** The most important "rule"—spending extra seconds to determine what physically needs to be done greatly lowers resistance to doing things.

4. **Trust the System:** The goal is 100% trust that nothing will be forgotten. This requires consistent processing and review.

5. **Brain as Whiteboard:** Keep your brain clear for drawing and combining ideas, not covered with to-do lists and "DO NOT ERASE."

## The Complete GTD Flow

```
CAPTURE → CLARIFY → ORGANIZE → REFLECT → ENGAGE
   ↓          ↓          ↓          ↓         ↓
  In     Processing   Lists     Review    Do It
        (2-min rule)  (contexts) (daily/   (Next
        (next action)           weekly)   Actions)
```

## Why GTD Works

When properly implemented, GTD provides:
- ✅ Foolproof system for tracking everything you need/should/might do
- ✅ Reduced stress from offloading mental tracking
- ✅ Freedom to focus on productive thinking
- ✅ Confidence that nothing will be forgotten
- ✅ Ability to handle urgent matters while making progress on strategic goals
- ✅ Clear mind for creativity and decision-making
