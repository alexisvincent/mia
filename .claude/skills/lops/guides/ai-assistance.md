# AI Assistance for LOPS

**Goal:** Leverage AI to automate and enhance your productivity system.

## The Purpose

AI can handle repetitive tasks, reduce friction, and help maintain your LOPS system with minimal manual effort. Modern AI task managers show **4.8x productivity improvements** through intelligent automation.

**Key insight:** AI excels at pattern matching, batch processing, and reducing decision fatigue - perfect for GTD workflows.

## How AI Can Help

AI assistance in LOPS falls into three categories:

1. **Automated Capture** - AI extracts tasks from various sources
2. **Intelligent Triage** - AI suggests labels, contexts, and priorities
3. **Workflow Assistance** - AI guides you through routines and reviews

---

## 1. Automated Capture

### Capture from Messages

AI can scan your communication channels and automatically create issues:

**WhatsApp/iMessage:**
- "Scan my WhatsApp messages from today and create Linear issues for any tasks mentioned"
- AI identifies action items and creates issues in Triage

**Email:**
- "Review my unread emails and extract any action items to Linear"
- AI parses emails for commitments and tasks

**Meeting Notes (Granola):**
- "Read this meeting transcript and create issues for all action items"
- AI identifies owners, due dates, and context

### Capture from Voice

**Voice-to-task:**
- Speak to AI: "Remind me to call Dr. Smith about prescription refill"
- AI creates properly formatted issue in Triage

**Brain dump:**
- "I'm going to brain dump some tasks, add them all to my Linear Triage"
- Speak stream-of-consciousness, AI captures and organizes

### Capture from Documents

**PDF/Document scanning:**
- "Read this document and create issues for any action items assigned to me"
- AI extracts tasks with context

---

## 2. Intelligent Triage

### AI-Assisted Clarify

When processing Triage items, AI can help clarify vague captures:

**Input:** "Something about quarterly taxes"

**Ask AI:** "Help me turn this into a clear next action"

**AI suggests:** "Call accountant Sarah at 555-1234 to ask about quarterly tax filing deadline"

### Automatic Label Suggestions

**Ask AI to suggest labels:**
```
"For this Linear issue, suggest:
- Energy level (high/medium/low)
- Context label (@computer, @phone, @outside, @home)
- Effort estimate (XS to XXXL)
- Whether it's an action or objective"
```

AI analyzes the task and provides recommendations you can apply with one click.

### Breaking Down Objectives

**Input:** "Launch new website redesign"

**Ask AI:** "Break this objective into specific next actions following LOPS principles"

**AI outputs:**
1. "Meet with designer Sarah to review current website pain points" (M, @computer, high-energy)
2. "Create list of 5 competitor websites to analyze" (S, @computer, medium-energy)
3. "Draft website goals document with key outcomes" (L, @computer, high-energy)

Each action is physical, visible, and properly scoped.

### Smart Context Detection

AI can automatically assign context labels:

- Mentions "call" or "phone" → @phone
- Mentions "email" or "browse" or "code" → @computer
- Mentions "pick up" or "buy" or "go to" → @outside
- Mentions specific home tasks → @home

## 3. Workflow Assistance

### Guided Triage Sessions

**Start triage with AI:**

"Help me run my daily triage session. Process my Linear Triage queue one item at a time."

**AI guides you through:**
1. Shows first item
2. Asks clarifying questions (Is it actionable? What's the next action?)
3. Suggests labels and context
4. Confirms where to organize it
5. Moves to next item

**Benefits:** Faster processing, consistent quality, no decision fatigue.

### Automated Weekly Review

**Prep for weekly review:**

"Prepare my weekly review. Show me:
- All objectives without next actions
- Items in This Week not marked done
- Waiting For items >1 week old
- Agenda items by person/meeting"

AI scans your Linear and generates the review agenda automatically.

### Smart Prioritization

**Daily planning with AI:**

"Help me prioritize today. I have 4 hours of focus time and medium energy."

**AI suggests:**
- Reviews This Week items
- Filters by energy level (medium)
- Estimates total time
- Recommends 3-5 items that fit

### Energy-Aware Suggestions

**Real-time task matching:**

"I'm exhausted right now. What low-energy tasks from my Next list can I do?"

AI filters Next list by low-energy label and suggests options.

## Using Linear MCP Tools

AI assistants with Linear MCP (Model Context Protocol) can directly interact with your Linear workspace.

### Common MCP Commands

**Create issues:**
```
"Create a Linear issue in Triage:
Title: Call dentist to schedule checkup
Context: @phone
Energy: low-energy
Estimate: XS"
```

**Search and filter:**
```
"Show me all issues in Next status"
"List all objectives without next actions"
"Find all high-energy items in This Week"
```

**Bulk updates:**
```
"Move all incomplete items from Next to This Week"
"Add low-energy label to all issues with 'admin' in title"
```

**Status checks:**
```
"How many items are in my Triage queue?"
"What objectives are in Backlog?"
"Show aging items in Waiting For"
```

## AI Assistance Patterns

### Pattern 1: Voice Capture + Auto-Triage

**Flow:**
1. Capture tasks via voice throughout the day
2. AI creates issues in Triage with basic labels
3. During triage session, review AI's suggestions and confirm/adjust

**Benefit:** Extremely low-friction capture, pre-processed for triage.

### Pattern 2: Inbox Processing

**Flow:**
1. AI scans communication channels (email, WhatsApp, Slack)
2. AI suggests potential tasks: "Is this actionable?"
3. You confirm, AI creates Triage issues
4. Process during triage as normal

**Benefit:** Nothing falls through cracks, automated extraction.

### Pattern 3: Guided Workflows

**Flow:**
1. Say "Run my morning startup routine"
2. AI walks through checklist step-by-step
3. AI queries Linear and shows relevant data
4. You make decisions, AI executes them

**Benefit:** Consistent routines, zero decision fatigue.

### Pattern 4: Natural Language Queries

**Examples:**
- "What should I work on right now?" (considers energy, time, Next list)
- "Am I overcommitted this week?" (analyzes This Week estimates vs. time)
- "Which objectives are stalled?" (finds objectives without next actions)

**Benefit:** Instant system health insights.
