# Writing a Great Next Action

The most important "rule" in GTD: a next action should be the next **physical, visible** action needed to move work forward.

## Why This Matters

Spending a few extra seconds to define what physically needs to be done:
- **Eliminates resistance** - No thinking required when you're ready to execute
- **Prevents stalling** - You won't look at it and say "what did I mean by this?"
- **Enables trust** - You know exactly what to do, which builds confidence in your system

## The Core Principle

**Physical and Visible:** The action must be concrete—something you can see yourself doing.

## Good vs Bad Examples

### ❌ Bad (Vague Goals)
- "Plan presentation"
- "Figure out marketing"
- "Research competitors"
- "Fix website"
- "Deal with taxes"

**Problem:** These require additional thinking to know where to start.

### ✅ Good (Physical, Visible Actions)
- "Open Google Slides and create title slide for Q1 review presentation"
- "Email Sarah and ask for recommendations on social media tools"
- "Google 'top e-commerce platforms 2025' and create comparison spreadsheet"
- "Check homepage on mobile and screenshot any layout issues"
- "Call accountant at 555-1234 to ask about quarterly filing deadline"

**Why they work:** You can immediately start doing them without any pre-planning.

## The Test

When you read your next action, ask yourself:

**"Can I start doing this right now without any additional thinking?"**

- If YES → Good next action
- If NO → Make it more specific

## Common Patterns

### Starting Actions
Use action verbs that describe exactly what you'll do first:
- "Open [tool] and..."
- "Email [person] and ask..."
- "Call [person] at [number] to..."
- "Google '[search term]' and..."
- "Review [document] and note..."

### Include Specifics
- **Names:** Who exactly? (not "the team" but "John, Sarah, and Michael")
- **Numbers:** Phone numbers, amounts, specific quantities
- **Tools:** Which app/system? (not "update document" but "update quarterly-goals.md in Notion")
- **Outcomes:** What will you have when done? (not "work on slides" but "create first 3 slides with titles")

### One Action, Not Many
Each next action should be ONE thing:

❌ "Email team, schedule meeting, and prepare agenda"
✅ "Email team to propose three meeting times for Q1 planning"

(The other actions become separate next actions)

## Context Matters

Add context labels so you know when you can do the action:
- **Computer** - "Browse competitor pricing pages and screenshot"
- **Phone** - "Call Dr. Smith at 555-1234 to schedule appointment"
- **Outside** - "Walgreens - pick up prescription"
- **Home** - "Measure bedroom wall for new bookshelf"

## Special Cases

### Planning Actions
Even planning needs to be physical:
- ❌ "Plan Q2 strategy"
- ✅ "Open blank doc and brainstorm 3 Q2 goals"

### Research Actions
Make research concrete:
- ❌ "Research CRM tools"
- ✅ "Google 'best CRM for small teams 2025' and list top 3 results"

### Thinking Actions
Yes, thinking can be physical:
- ❌ "Think about career"
- ✅ "Grab notebook and write pros/cons list for job offer"

## The 2-Minute Rule

If the action takes less than 2 minutes, don't write it down—just do it immediately.

## ADHD-Friendly Tips

- **Lower activation energy:** The more specific, the easier to start
- **Reduce decision fatigue:** Pre-decide everything during triage, not during execution
- **Start with the smallest possible step:** "Open Google Docs" is sometimes enough
- **Use the AI:** If stuck, ask the AI to help you break it down into a physical action

## Remember

The goal isn't perfection—it's clarity. If you can look at the action and immediately know what to do without pausing to think, you've succeeded.
