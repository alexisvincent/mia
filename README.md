# Mia

An AI personal assistant and automation system designed to maximize productivity for people with ADHD.

## Vision

Mia is an intelligent task management system that automatically captures, prioritizes, and helps complete tasks from across all your communication channels. The core philosophy is to minimize the time tasks spend waiting in queue and maximize your ability to respond quickly to what matters.

## Core Concepts

### Automatic Task Capture
Mia monitors your communication streams (WhatsApp, email, text messages) and automatically detects when someone asks you to do something or when there's an action item. These are automatically converted into tracked tasks.

### AI-Assisted Execution
Beyond just capturing tasks, Mia helps you complete them:
- Draft replies automatically
- Suggest responses
- Understand context and dependencies
- Prioritize based on importance and urgency

### Queue Time Optimization
The key innovation: track how long each task has been waiting and actively work to minimize response times. Tasks are graded by importance, and the system tracks:
- When tasks arrived
- How long they've been in queue
- What's blocking quick resolution

### Unified Task Management
All tasks flow into Linear, providing a single source of truth for what needs to be done. Calendar integration helps with scheduling and time management.

### Daily Workflows
- **Morning routines**: Review incoming tasks before they're added to Linear
- **Daily summaries**: Get an overview of what's going well and what needs attention
- **Proactive notifications**: Be reminded of aging tasks before they become problems

## Target User
