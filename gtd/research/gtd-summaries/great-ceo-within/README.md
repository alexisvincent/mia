## Introduction

> "Great companies are made up of great individual performers who work well together as a team. As CEO, you are both the architect of the culture and the central hub in the wheel of information flow that enables the team to function effectively. Your example inspires your team, and your efficiency determines the efficiency of the team. Therefore, the first thing to optimize is yourself."

The following three chapters outline the most effective habits and methods for fostering individual productivity as a CEO.

## Chapter 3: Getting Things Done (GTD)

### Overview

Everyone needs an organizational system to track goals, priorities, and tasks. The majority of successful CEOs use the system outlined in David Allen's book *Getting Things Done: The art of stress-free productivity*. While the book is dense, it is definitely worth reading in its entirety.

### The Core Principle

**Each day, process every single item in your Inbox** (defined broadly as all Inboxes [email, Slack, text] and all to-do's).

**The Two-Minute Rule:** If the action takes <2 minutes to complete, do it immediately. If not, then write down what the required action is, and place it in one of the following lists:

### The Seven Lists

#### 1. Next Actions

These are the next tasks on your priority list **separated into areas of context**.

**Contexts:**
- **Computer** - Actions where you need access to your computer
- **Calls** - Phone calls that can be completed when you don't have access to a computer (e.g., riding in a car)
- **Outside** - Actions that can only be completed outside, such as errands
- **Home** - Actions that can only be completed at home

**Key Principle:** Tasks should be written as **single actions** (as opposed to broad goals). The key is to not have to think about what needs to be done again once the Next Action has been written down. The Next Action should be written so clearly that all you need to do is follow its direction when you read it next.

**Examples:**

**Computer**
- Write first draft of 10-year Company Vision and 3-month Roadmap
- Write first draft of Sales Playbook

**Calls**
- John 650-555-3452 schedule company offsite
- Mary 415-555-1234 review draft financing docs, paragraph by paragraph

**Outside**
- Walgreens - pick up prescription

**Home**
- Clean out garage

#### 2. Waiting For

This is the list of things that you have **asked others to do**, and are waiting for them to complete.

**Format:** List the person to whom you have delegated, the requested action, and **the date on which you made the request**.

**Usage:** You can then easily scan your Waiting For list and see which aging requests are still outstanding. Move these aging requests to your Next Action list and ask the person again for the item.

**Examples:**

**Waiting For**
- Sarah- feedback on Sales Playbook, 3-18
- Jim - Write-up issue for next Leadership Team Meeting, 3-19
- Bill- time to meet, 3-19

#### 3. Someday/Maybe

This is the list of things that you **one day want to do**, but don't need to get done now (e.g., read a book).

**Examples:**

**Someday/Maybe**
- Schedule a guitar lesson
- Order the book Getting Things Done by David Allen

#### 4. Agenda

**Problem:** Inefficient leaders waste a lot of time reaching out about, or responding to, one-off issues in real-time.

**Solution:** A much more efficient method is to **batch your issues and discuss them all at once**.

**Important:** This does not apply for urgent issues. Those need to be addressed immediately. But by addressing many issues on a regular basis, soon urgent issues will disappear.

**How to Use:**
- Create and use an Agenda list - your list of regular meetings
- When you think of something that you want to discuss with someone with whom you meet regularly, write it down on your Agenda list
- When you meet with that person, check your Agenda list and review everything accumulated there

**Examples:**

**Spouse**
- What should we do for our winter holiday?
- Connect- listen to each other's day for 10 minutes each

**Leadership Team**
- Are we having enough fun?
- 10-year Company Vision
- 3-month Company Roadmap

#### 5. Projects

This list is for projects that have **more than one Next Action that can only be done one after the other (serially)**.

**Process:**
- Write out all of the Next Actions required to get to completion
- Simply add them chronologically to your Next Actions list as the previous action is completed

#### 6. Review

This is your pace for reviewing the lists above.

**Review Schedule:**
- **Daily:** Next Action and Waiting For
- **Weekly:** Someday/Maybe, Agenda and Projects

**Calendar Integration:** Use your calendar to schedule Next Actions that need to happen on a certain day or at a certain time. **Recommendation:** Actually put your reviews in your calendar.

#### 7. Goals

**Note:** This is not part of Allen's GTD, but the author uses it and finds it very helpful.

**Purpose:** Keep a copy of your:
- 10 Year Vision
- Quarterly OKRs
- Department, Team and Individual quarterly OKRs

**Usage:** Refer to it regularly to flesh out your Next Action list.

## Chapter 4: Inbox Zero

### The Problem

We all get deluged on a daily basis with Inbox messages from email, text, Slack, CRMs and other online tools. It's critical to have a thoughtful methodology for dealing with them all—otherwise, you'll be buried in communications and you'll risk missing time-sensitive messages.

### The Hospital Triage Room Metaphor

**Think of your combined inboxes as a single triage room at a hospital.**

- Some cases that come in are urgent, others not so much
- It is critical to notice the urgent cases immediately, and get them in to see a doctor now
- To do so, you **must keep the triage room clear**

**The Problem with Mixing Functions:**

If you use the triage room as a waiting room as well, then a new patient can enter the room, sit down in a chair, and bleed out from his stab wound before you even realize he is there.

**The Solution:**

For this reason, every well-functioning hospital **separates its triage room from its waiting room**, and keeps the triage room absolutely clear.

**Application:** To be efficient, you must do the same with your inbox. This means addressing all the urgent cases right away, and **maintaining Inbox Zero every day**.

### The Batching Strategy

**Don't:** Check your email incessantly, multiple times an hour (you are wasting hours of productivity)

**Do:** Batch your time and clean out your entire inbox at those times

**Recommendation:** Check your inbox only **twice a day** (once in the morning, once in the afternoon)

### The Inbox Zero Process

Each time you check your inbox, follow this process:

#### 1. Two-Minute Rule
If the email/message takes less than two minutes to address, **do it immediately**.

#### 2. Write Next Actions
If it takes more than two minutes, write down a Next Action for it (according to the Getting Things Done methodology) and then place the email in its correct location:
- Next Action
- Waiting For
- Someday/Maybe
- Reference

**Implementation Tip:** The best way to do this when using Gmail is to read and implement Andreas Klinger's [iconic blogpost on GTD in Gmail](https://klinger.io/posts/gtd-in-15-minutes). In it, Andreas explains how to use Gmail's Multiple Inbox feature to create an inbox for Next Action, Waiting For, Someday/Maybe, and Reference. You can set the system up in 15 minutes.

#### 3. Repeat Until Inbox Zero
Repeat until you get to Inbox Zero. If you are truly fearless, you can get to Inbox Zero within the hour (**yes, even if you have 1,000s of emails in your Inbox right now**).

## Chapter 5: Top Goal

### The CEO's Dilemma

**The Problem:** In startups, fires never cease to burn. One of the most common complaints from CEOs is that on a day-to-day basis they seem to have infinite things to do, yet **weeks will go by and they don't feel like they have accomplished anything**.

**The Cause:** This is the result of getting bogged down with the small immediate things and losing track of the important long-term ones.

### The Solution: Top Goal Framework

Greg McKeown, who wrote a phenomenal book on productivity called *Essentialism*, boils this down to one key concept:

> **Schedule two hours each day to work on your Top Goal only. And do this every single work day. Period.**

### Implementation Guidelines

#### Timing Matters

**Schedule Early:** The earlier in the day you schedule this Top Goal time, the better, so as to avoid other issues (and people) from pressing for your attention.

**Brain Science:** There is also strong research-backed evidence to show that we have more decision and thought-processing energy early in the day when our brain is freshly rested. **Take advantage of this high-quality brain functioning by doing the important stuff first.**

#### Rules During Top Goal Time

**During this Top Goal time:**
- ❌ Do NOT respond to emails
- ❌ Do NOT respond to texts
- ❌ Do NOT respond to calls
- ❌ Do NOT respond to messages
- ✅ Only work on your **top priority** (your top goal for the current quarter [3 months]) during these two hours

**Result:** If you follow this pattern each workday, you will achieve amazing things.

### Getting Started: The Gradual Approach

If you have never scheduled this kind of focused work time, starting off with two hours a day will likely be too great of a leap.

**Progressive Schedule:**

**Week 1:**
- Start by scheduling **30 minutes** for tomorrow early in the day
- If that goes well, schedule 30 minutes each weekday morning for a week

**Week 2:**
- If that goes well, increase the daily scheduled time to **one hour**

**Weeks 3+:**
- Continue increasing each week until you find the right balance
- **Target:** Two hours daily

## The Through-Line

These three chapters form a complete productivity system for CEOs:

1. **GTD (Chapter 3):** Provides the framework for capturing and organizing all work
2. **Inbox Zero (Chapter 4):** Ensures you handle incoming communications efficiently
3. **Top Goal (Chapter 5):** Guarantees progress on strategic priorities despite daily fires

Together, they enable you to:
- ✅ Never miss important tasks
- ✅ Handle urgent matters promptly
- ✅ Make consistent progress on strategic goals
- ✅ Maintain clarity and reduce stress
- ✅ Lead by example through personal efficiency

**The Result:** As CEO, your personal efficiency becomes the team's efficiency, and your example becomes the culture.
