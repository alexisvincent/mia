# LOPS System Overview

**LOPS** = LEX OPS (LEX = ALEXIS)

A highly systematized GTD-based methodology designed to maximize personal productivity by capturing work, executing efficiently, and building unshakeable trust in the system.

## GTD Foundation

Getting Things Done (GTD) is a productivity methodology by David Allen designed to create 100% trust in a system for collecting tasks, ideas, and projects.

**The Core Insight:** Your brain is terrible at remembering things at the right time—it creates an incessant feeling of "I need to remember... something" instead of reminding you when you actually need to act.

**The Solution:** Offload your brain by capturing everything into a trusted external system. When your system and your trust in it are solid, your subconsciousness stops tracking tasks and frees up mental energy for productive thinking and creativity.

**Key Principle:** Convert vague thoughts into clear, physical, visible actions. This reduces resistance to doing things because the "pre-processing" is already done.

LOPS adapts GTD principles to work within Linear and with AI assistance. For a comprehensive overview of traditional GTD, see [gtd-summary.md](./gtd-summary.md).

## The System

LOPS implements GTD using Linear as the primary tool, with AI assistance for capture and triage.
