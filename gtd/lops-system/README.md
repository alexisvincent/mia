# LOPS System Overview

**LOPS** = LEX OPS (LEX = ALEXIS)

A highly systematized GTD-based methodology designed to maximize personal productivity by capturing work, executing efficiently, and building unshakeable trust in the system.

## GTD Foundation

Getting Things Done (GTD) is a productivity methodology by David Allen designed to create 100% trust in a system for collecting tasks, ideas, and projects.

**The Core Insight:** Your brain is terrible at remembering things at the right time—it creates an incessant feeling of "I need to remember... something" instead of reminding you when you actually need to act.

**The Solution:** Offload your brain by capturing everything into a trusted external system. When your system and your trust in it are solid, your subconsciousness stops tracking tasks and frees up mental energy for productive thinking and creativity.

**Key Principle:** Convert vague thoughts into clear, physical, visible actions. This reduces resistance to doing things because the "pre-processing" is already done.

LOPS adapts GTD principles to work within Linear and with AI assistance. For a comprehensive overview of traditional GTD, see [gtd-summary.md](./gtd-summary.md).

## The System

LOPS implements GTD using Linear as the primary tool, with AI assistance for capture and triage. For a detailed description of how the system is structured and how it maps GTD concepts to Linear, see [system.md](./system.md).

## Core Workflows

For detailed workflow guides, see the [workflows/](./workflows/) directory.

### 0. Collect (Daily, 5-10 min)
- Consolidate captures from all channels into Linear Triage queue
- Bridge between distributed capture and centralized processing
- Will be automated in the future

See [workflows/triage/collect.md](./workflows/triage/collect.md) for detailed process.

### 1. Capture (Ongoing)
- Extract thoughts, tasks, and reference items from your brain into the system
- Multi-channel capture: AI assistant, WhatsApp, voice input, etc.
- Automated ingestion: Reading messages and suggesting items for capture
- Goal: Get everything out of your head

See [workflows/capture.md](./workflows/capture.md) for detailed process.

### 2. Triage (Daily, 15-30 min)
- **Collect:** Consolidate captures from all capture channels into Triage queue
- **Clarify:** Determine what each item in triage means and what action is needed
- **Organize:** Put clarified items in the right place with appropriate metadata
- Output: Clear, actionable items ready for prioritization

See [workflows/triage.md](./workflows/triage.md) for overview, and sub-workflows:
- [Collect](./workflows/triage/collect.md)
- [Clarify](./workflows/triage/clarify.md)
- [Organize](./workflows/triage/organize.md)

### 3. Prioritize (Daily & Weekly)
- Daily: Select 3-5 most important items for today
- Daily: Protect time for Top Goal work (most important quarterly priority)
- Weekly: Choose 10-15 items from Backlog for the coming week
- Reassess incomplete items from previous periods
- Goal: Keep focus tight and realistic

See [workflows/prioritize.md](./workflows/prioritize.md) for detailed process.

### 4. Review (Weekly, 30+ min)
- Maintain project momentum by ensuring each has a next action
- Clean up stale or unrealistic items from active lists
- Surface and capture any missed commitments or open loops
- Prune Someday/Maybe and activate ready items
- Realign work with quarterly goals and assess system health

See [workflows/review.md](./workflows/review.md) for detailed process.
