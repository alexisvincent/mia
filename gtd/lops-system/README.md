Getting Things Done (GTD) is a productivity methodology by David Allen that uses a simple system of capturing all tasks and ideas, clarifying what each one means and what action is needed, organizing everything by context and priority, and then engaging confidently with your work knowing nothing will be forgotten. For a detailed overview of how GTD typically works, see [gtd-summary.md](./gtd-summary.md).
