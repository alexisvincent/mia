# Organize Workflow

**Part of:** Triage - Step 2: Process

**Goal:** Put clarified items in the right places with appropriate metadata.

## The Purpose

Organize takes what you decided during Clarify and puts it where it belongs in the system. This ensures everything is categorized correctly and has the metadata needed for execution.

## The Organize Process

Based on what you determined during [Clarify](./clarify.md), organize the item:

### If Not Actionable

- **Trash** → Delete the issue
- **Reference** → Save in appropriate reference system (link in issue notes if needed), then delete/archive issue
- **Incubate** → Move to Someday/Maybe status and set due date or reminder for when to revisit

### If Actionable

#### 1. Two-Minute Rule (Actions Only)

If this is an **Action**, ask: **Can this be done in under 2 minutes?**

**YES** → Do it immediately, then mark issue as Done

**NO** → Continue to step 2

#### 2. Should I Delegate?

**Default to delegation when possible.** Ask: **Am I the right person to do this, or can someone else do it?**

This applies to both **Actions** and **Objectives**—look for opportunities to delegate entire objectives or individual actions.

**Who can do this?** Team members, friends, family, contractors (Fiverr, TaskRabbit, etc.), AI agents—anyone or anything appropriate for the task.

**Delegate** → Note assignee and today's date, will go to Waiting For in step 3

**Do myself** → Continue to step 3

#### 3. Choose the Status (List)

Move to the appropriate list based on timing and type:

- **Backlog** - Default for actionable items (core Next Actions list)
- **Waiting For** - If delegated (add assignee and date in description)
- **Agenda** - If it's for a specific meeting/person discussion

#### 4. Add Context Labels

**Context** (where/how it can be done):
- **@computer** - Requires computer access
- **@phone** - Phone calls, or tasks best completed on your phone
- **@outside** - Errands requiring going out, or meeting someone away from home
- **@home** - Actions only possible at home

**Agenda** (if using Agenda status):
- **agenda-[person]** - For specific person/meeting (e.g., agenda-spouse, agenda-john)
- Use these to batch discussion items for regular meetings instead of handling one-off in real-time

#### 5. Add Additional Metadata

As needed:
- **Due date** - Only if truly deadline-driven (don't use for "I want it done by")
- **Description** - Add context, links, or details needed for execution
- **Estimate** - If helpful for planning

## Output

After organizing, the item should be:
- ✅ In the correct status/list
- ✅ Context and agenda labels added as appropriate
- ✅ Necessary metadata for execution added

## Result

The item is now out of Triage and properly organized in the system, ready for prioritization and execution.
