# Clarify Workflow

**Part of:** Triage - Step 2: Process

**Goal:** Determine what each inbox item means and what needs to be done about it.

## The Purpose

Clarify is the thinking work—transforming vague captures into concrete understanding. You're answering "What is this?" and "What do I need to do about it?"

**Before starting:** Read [Writing a Great Next Action](../../guides/writing-next-actions.md) to understand how to write clear, physical, visible actions.

## The Clarify Process

For each item in the Triage queue, ask these questions:

### 1. Is it actionable?

Does this require me to do something?

**NO** → Choose one:
- **Trash** - No longer needed, delete it (reject)
- **Reference** - Might need later, save somewhere appropriate
- **Incubate** - Remind me about this on a specific date (set due date or reminder)

**YES** → Continue to question 2

### 2. What is the next physical, visible action?

Ask: "What is the next physical, visible action needed to do this?"

Try to rewrite the item as a concrete next action. Make it specific enough that you won't need to think when executing.

- ❌ Not "deal with taxes"
- ✅ But "Call accountant at 555-1234 to ask about quarterly filing deadline"

See [Writing a Great Next Action](../../guides/writing-next-actions.md) for detailed guidance.

### 3. Is this a single action or an objective?

If you complete that next action, is the item done?

**Single Action** → This is an **Action**. The next action you defined IS the task. Ready for Organize step.

**Multiple Steps or Unclear** → This is an **Objective**. Either:
- Multiple steps are clearly required, OR
- The next action is unclear/undefined

Continue to question 4 to define the objective.

### 4. Define the Objective

**What does "done" look like?** Write a clear objective title describing the completed state.

- ✅ Good: "Website redesign completed and launched to production"
- ❌ Bad: "Work on website"

**Can you now define a next action?** If yes, go back to question 2 and define it (this will become a child action of the objective).

If you can't define "done" clearly, it may need to go to Someday/Maybe.

### 5. Estimate the effort

**How much effort will this take?** Assign a T-shirt size estimate:

- **XS** (1pt) - Trivial, 5-15 min
- **S** (2pt) - Simple, 15-30 min
- **M** (3pt) - Medium, 30 min - 1 hour
- **L** (5pt) - Large, 1-2 hours
- **XL** (8pt) - Very large, 2-4 hours
- **XXL** (13pt) - Major, 4-8 hours (consider breaking down)
- **XXXL** (21pt) - Huge, 1+ days (should be broken into smaller tasks)

**For Objectives:** Estimate the total effort for the entire objective, or leave unestimated and rely on child action estimates.

**Tip:** If estimating feels difficult, the task may not be well-clarified yet. Return to question 2.

## Output

After clarifying each item, you should know:
- ✅ Whether it's actionable
- ✅ The specific next action (if actionable)
- ✅ Whether it's an Action or Objective
- ✅ If Objective: what "done" looks like
- ✅ Any relevant context (where/how it can be done)
- ✅ Effort estimate (T-shirt size)

## Next Step

Once clarified, proceed to [Organize](./organize.md) to put the item in the right place with appropriate metadata.
