Triage consists of two steps:

### Step 1: Collect (5-10 min)

Consolidate all captures from various channels into Linear Triage queue.

See [Collect Workflow](./triage/collect.md) for detailed process.

### Step 2: Process (15-20 min)

Process each item in Triage queue through clarify and organize:

1. **[Clarify](./triage/clarify.md)** - Determine what the item means and what action is needed
2. **[Organize](./triage/organize.md)** - Put the item in the right place with appropriate metadata

Repeat for each item until Triage queue is empty.
