# GTD + Linear: Overview

## Why GTD + Linear?

GTD provides the methodology for stress-free productivity, while Linear provides the tooling for knowledge work. This implementation leverages:

- **Linear's status workflows** for prioritized action management
- **Labels** for context-based organization and project identification
- **Parent/sub-issues** for multi-step outcomes
- **Filters and views** for context-specific action lists

## Key Principles

1. **Capture everything** - Use Linear issues to externalize all open loops
2. **Clarify to physical actions** - Every issue title must be a concrete, visible action
3. **Organize by context** - Use labels to enable location/tool/energy-based filtering
4. **Prioritize progressively** - Funnel from Backlog → This Week → Next
5. **Review regularly** - Weekly and daily reviews keep the system trusted and current
6. **Engage confidently** - Choose actions based on context, time, energy, and priority

## Core GTD to Linear Mapping

### The GTD Lists to Linear States

| GTD List | Linear Implementation | Purpose |
|----------|----------------------|---------|
| **Inbox (In)** | State: `Triage` | Capture all new items here for processing |
| **Next Actions** | States: `Backlog` → `This Week` → `Next` + Context Labels | Prioritized funnel of actions ready to execute |
| **Waiting For** | State: `Waiting For` + Assignee | Items delegated or blocked by others |
| **Projects** | Parent Issues + `Topic` Label | Multi-step outcomes (parent issues with sub-issues) |
| **Someday/Maybe** | State: `Someday/Maybe` | Ideas to consider later |
| **Agenda** | Labels: `@agenda-[person]` | Items to discuss in regular meetings |
| **Calendar** | Due Dates (sparingly) | Time/date-specific commitments ONLY |

### The Prioritization Funnel

Instead of a single "Next Actions" list, actions flow through a **progressive prioritization funnel**:

```
Triage (Inbox)
    ↓
    Process & Clarify
    ↓
Backlog (Approved, not scheduled)
    ↓
    Weekly Planning
    ↓
This Week (Committed for this week)
    ↓
    Daily Planning
    ↓
Next (Doing today)
    ↓
In Progress (Actively working now)
    ↓
Done / Canceled

Side branches:
├→ Waiting For (delegated/blocked)
├→ Someday/Maybe (incubate)
```

**The Flow:**
- **Backlog** = Approved actions, not yet scheduled
- **This Week** = Committed to complete/progress this week (weekly planning)
- **Next** = Doing today (daily planning)
- **In Progress** = Actively working on right now
- **Waiting For** = Delegated or blocked by others
- **Someday/Maybe** = Ideas to review later

## State Definitions

**1. Triage**
- Inbox for all new captures
- Process daily to zero
- Items move from here to other states

**2. Backlog**
- Actions that are clarified and ready to work on
- Organized by context labels
- Pool to pull from during weekly planning
- Both atomic actions AND topic issues (projects)

**3. This Week**
- Committed to complete or progress this week
- Selected during weekly planning
- Realistic scope (10-15 items)
- Both atomic actions AND topic issues actively being worked on

**4. Next**
- Doing today
- Selected during daily planning
- Short list (3-5 items)
- Top priority work for the day

**5. In Progress**
- Actively working on right now
- Limit to 1-3 items simultaneously
- Move here when you start work
- Both atomic actions AND topic issues near completion

**6. Waiting For**
- Delegated to someone else
- Blocked by external dependency
- Always include date delegated and who

**7. Someday/Maybe**
- Ideas to consider later
- Reviewed during weekly review
- No pressure to complete

**8. Done / Canceled**
- Completed successfully (Done)
- No longer relevant (Canceled)

## The Goal

**"Mind like water"** - calm readiness where you trust your system completely and can focus entirely on the work at hand. No mental RAM wasted on remembering. Just doing.
