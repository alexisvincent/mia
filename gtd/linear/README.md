# GTD Implementation in Linear

A comprehensive guide for implementing David Allen's Getting Things Done methodology using Linear's issue tracking system with prioritized action lists.

## Quick Start

1. **New to GTD?** Start with [Overview](./overview.md) to understand the core concepts
2. **Ready to implement?** Follow the [Setup Guide](./setup-guide.md)
3. **System is set up?** Use the [Daily Workflows](./daily-workflows.md) and [Weekly Review](./weekly-review.md)

## Documentation Structure

### Core Documentation

- **[Overview](./overview.md)** - Why GTD + Linear, key principles, and core mappings
- **[Setup Guide](./setup-guide.md)** - Complete setup instructions (30-60 minutes)
- **[Daily Workflows](./daily-workflows.md)** - Morning planning, inbox processing, action selection
- **[Weekly Review](./weekly-review.md)** - Weekly review checklist and detailed workflow

### Advanced Topics

- **[Advanced Patterns](./advanced-patterns.md)** - Topic issues (projects), natural planning, agendas, interruptions
- **[ADHD Tips](./adhd-tips.md)** - Specific strategies for ADHD management
- **[Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.md)** - Common issues and solutions

## The 5-Minute Summary

### The Five Core Workflows

**Ongoing:**
1. **Capture** - Collect everything that has your attention into trusted inboxes (Triage state in Linear). Includes physical items, digital inputs, and mental open loops. Goal: Get everything out of your head.

2. **Engage** - Throughout the day: Choose what to do next based on context, time available, energy level, and priority. Work from "Next" list, complete and mark Done or move to Waiting For if blocked.

**Daily:**
3. **Triage** - Process each item in Triage: Is it actionable? What's the next physical action? Takes <2 minutes? Delegate? Then immediately organize it into the right place (Backlog, Waiting For, Someday/Maybe, etc.) with appropriate labels. Goal: Empty Triage to zero.

4. **Prioritize (Daily)** - Review leftovers from yesterday, examine "This Week" items, select 3-5 for today, move to "Next" state, prioritize the list. Funnel: This Week → Next.

**Weekly:**
5. **Review** - Process all inboxes to zero, review all projects (ensure each has ≥1 next action), review Waiting For, review Someday/Maybe, clean up system. Maintains trust in the system.

6. **Prioritize (Weekly)** - Review leftovers from last week, review calendar for upcoming commitments, consider available contexts, move 10-15 items from Backlog → This Week, balance contexts and energy levels. Funnel: Backlog → This Week.

### The Prioritization Funnel

```
Triage (Inbox) → Process daily
    ↓
Backlog (Approved, not scheduled) → Pool of ready actions
    ↓
This Week (Committed for this week) → Weekly planning
    ↓
Next (Doing today) → Daily planning
    ↓
Done / Canceled or Waiting For (if blocked)
```
