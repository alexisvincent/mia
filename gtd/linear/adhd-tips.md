# Tips for ADHD Management

Since the primary user has ADHD, these patterns optimize for executive function support:

## 1. Friction Reduction

### Use "Executable" label religiously

- Marks tasks requiring zero planning
- Reduces decision paralysis
- Enables quick wins for momentum

### Quick capture everywhere

- Mobile: Use Linear mobile app with voice input
- Desktop: Use Linear quick add (Cmd+K → "New Issue")

### Progressive prioritization reduces overwhelm

- Don't look at all of Backlog when choosing what to do
- Look at Next (3-5 items)
- If Next is empty, look at This Week (10-15 items)
- Funnel keeps decisions manageable

## 2. External Memory

### Never trust your brain for reminders

- All open loops must be in Linear
- Use comments for context you'll forget
- Add agenda items immediately when you think of them
- Capture interruptions in Triage, process later

## 3. Context Optimization

### Energy-based contexts are critical

- `@high-energy` - Schedule these for your peak times (usually morning)
- `@low-energy` - Save for afternoon slumps
- `@creative` - Protect creative time, don't waste on admin

### Batch similar contexts

- Make all calls in one session (@calls)
- Process all computer work together (@computer)
- Do all errands at once (@errands)
- Reduces context switching cost (expensive for ADHD brains)

## 4. Visual Clarity

### Minimize cognitive load in views

- Use status colors effectively
- Keep Next list short (3-5 items)
- Keep This Week realistic (10-15 items)
- Filter out topics when choosing actions (NOT label:Topic)
- Archive aggressively to reduce visual clutter

## 5. Momentum Building

### Start with quick wins

- First thing in morning: View Executable items in Next
- Complete 2-3 quick items for momentum
- Dopamine hits from completion fuel the day

### Time-box processing

- Set 25-minute timer for inbox processing
- Prevents getting stuck on single item
- Maintains flow state
- Use Pomodoro technique

### Small, achievable lists

- Next = 3-5 items (can definitely complete today)
- This Week = 10-15 items (realistic for week)
- Success breeds motivation

## 6. Weekly Review Non-Negotiable

### Make it a hard commitment

- Schedule with another person for accountability
- Same time, same place every week
- Treat it like a meeting that can't be moved
- It's the most important hour of your week

### Gamify it

- Track weekly review streak
- Celebrate completion (reward yourself)
- Use the checklist issue template (reduces friction)
- Make it pleasant (good coffee, favorite music, comfortable space)

## 7. Daily Planning Ritual

### Consistent morning routine

- Same time every day (builds habit)
- Before checking email/Slack
- 10-15 minutes
- Creates structure and predictability

### Visual progress

- Watch Next list shrink throughout day
- Move items to Done (satisfying!)
- Celebrate completed This Week items at end of week
