# Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions.

## "My inbox never gets to zero"

**Solutions:**
- Block dedicated time (not interruptible)
- Use 2-minute rule strictly (do it or defer it)
- Don't organize while processing - just decide and move
- Break large items into smaller pieces (create topic)
- Be honest about Someday/Maybe vs. actual commitments
- Time-box processing (25-30 min max)

## "I have too many items in Backlog"

**Solutions:**
- Move non-urgent items to Someday/Maybe
- Be ruthless about what stays in Backlog
- Are some actually topics? (need planning/breakdown)
- Review and cancel stale items weekly
- Backlog should be "ready to work on" not "ideas"

## "I'm not completing my This Week commitments"

**Solutions:**
- You're over-committing - choose fewer items (start with 5-7, not 10-15)
- Are items actually executable? (Add more sub-tasks if needed)
- Wrong context mix? (Ensure you have access to contexts)
- Unexpected work showed up? (Budget 30% for interruptions)
- Energy mismatch? (Balance high/low energy items)

## "I'm not doing my weekly reviews"

**Solutions:**
- Schedule with accountability partner
- Make it sacred (non-negotiable appointment)
- Reduce time commitment (start with 30 min minimum)
- Use checklist issue template (reduces friction)
- Track streak to build habit
- Make it enjoyable (good location, coffee, music)

## "Context labels aren't helping"

**Solutions:**
- Too many contexts? Simplify to 5-7 core ones
- Labels too granular? Combine similar contexts
- Not using them consistently? Add during processing
- Create saved views/filters for each context
- Remove labels that aren't useful after 2 weeks

## "Topic issues don't have next actions"

**Solutions:**
- Add "Review topics" to weekly review checklist
- When completing sub-issue, immediately add next sub-issue
- Use parent/sub-issue pattern (visual reminder)
- Create filter: `label:Topic AND NOT state:Done` then check sub-issues

## "I'm not capturing everything"

**Solutions:**
- Lower barrier (quick add shortcuts: Cmd+K)
- Capture tools always available (phone, notebook)
- Process captured items same day (builds trust)
- Don't pre-filter during capture (capture everything)
- Review trigger lists weekly

## "Too many items in Next"

**Solutions:**
- Only 3-5 items should be in Next
- Move extras back to This Week
- Be realistic about what you can do today
- Next is TODAY, not this week

## "Topics are cluttering my action lists"

**Solutions:**
- Use filters: `state:Next AND NOT label:Topic`
- Topics show progress, sub-issues are the actions
- Filter topics out when choosing actions
- Filter topics IN when reviewing projects
