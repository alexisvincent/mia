# Solving GTD for Alexis

We're implementing Getting Things Done (GTD) methodology, adapted and customized for Alexis, using Linear as the core platform for task tracking and list management. The system uses a progressive prioritization funnel (Triage → Backlog → This Week → Next → Done) to organize all work. An AI agent acts as a project manager, helping to prioritize tasks, define clear next actions, assign appropriate labels and contexts, and handle inbox triage. The agent intelligently assists with system maintenance and ensures all open loops are captured, clarified, and organized into actionable items.
