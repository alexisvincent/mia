- Track and iterate on what works

## Structure

- **adhd-strategies.md** - Specific techniques and mental tricks for managing ADHD-related challenges
- **daily-rhythm.md** - Establishing consistent sleep/wake cycles and optimized morning routines
- *Additional optimization areas to be added as needed*

## Key Focus Areas

1. **ADHD Management** - Strategies for tasks lacking immediate rewards/deadlines
2. **Productivity Systems** - Frameworks for consistent high performance
3. **Energy Management** - Optimizing physical and mental energy
4. **Decision Making** - Reducing friction in choices and actions

## Philosophy

- Minimize cognitive load and friction
- Make the right action the easiest action
- Embrace "good enough" over perfection
- Gamify and track progress where possible
- Build systems that work with your brain, not against it
