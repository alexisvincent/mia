# ADHD Strategies

## The Core Challenge

**Tasks that don't have an immediate deadline or immediate benefit/reward are the hardest to execute.**

The ADHD brain struggles with:
- Delayed gratification
- Abstract or distant rewards
- Long-term projects without visible progress
- Tasks that feel overwhelming or unclear

## Mental Tricks & Strategies

### 1. Quantify the Benefit

**Problem**: Tasks feel abstract or their value is unclear.

**Solution**: Explicitly calculate and write down the concrete benefit.

- What will this accomplish?
- How much time/money/stress will this save?
- What becomes possible after this is done?
- What's the actual cost of NOT doing this?

Make the invisible visible. Put a number on it.

### 2. Break Down Into Smallest Possible Chunks

**Problem**: Tasks feel overwhelming and impossible to start.

**Solution**: Decompose into micro-tasks that can be completed in one session.

- Each chunk should be completable in 5-30 minutes
- Each chunk should have a clear "done" state
- Start with the easiest chunk first
- Celebrate each completion

The goal is momentum, not perfection.

### 3. Acknowledge Imperfection Immediately

**Problem**: Perfectionism creates paralysis and prevents starting.

**Solution**: Explicitly declare at the start: "This doesn't need to be perfect."

- Done is better than perfect
- Version 1 is meant to be improved later
- The act of starting reveals what actually needs to be good
- Perfect is the enemy of shipped

Write "Good enough" on a sticky note if needed.

### 4. Gamify with Speed Tracking

**Problem**: Tasks lack inherent reward structure.

**Solution**: Turn task completion into a game with a score: response time.

- Track: How quickly can you respond to/complete this?
- Measure: Time from task identification to task completion
- Compete: Beat your previous best time
- Visualize: Keep a log of response times

The game becomes: "How fast can I close this loop?"

## Implementation

When facing a difficult task:

1. ⏱️ **Start Timer** - Track your response time
2. 💰 **Quantify Benefit** - Write down what you gain
3. 🧩 **Break Down** - Identify the smallest first step
4. ✅ **Declare "Good Enough"** - State acceptable completion criteria
5. 🚀 **Start the Easiest Chunk** - Build momentum
6. 📊 **Log Completion Time** - Update your score

## Success Metrics

- Response time (from task identification to completion)
- Number of tasks completed (not perfect tasks)
- Momentum maintained (consecutive days with progress)
- Stress levels (subjective rating)

*Remember: The goal is progress, not perfection. The strategy is to work with your brain's reward system, not against it.*
