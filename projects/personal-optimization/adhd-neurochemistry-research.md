# ADHD Neurochemistry and Medication Overview

## 1. Core Problem in ADHD

* ADHD brains have **underactive prefrontal cortex (PFC)** circuits regulating attention, motivation, and impulse control.
* These rely on two neurotransmitters: **dopamine** and **norepinephrine**.
* Low baseline levels cause poor focus, impulsivity, and weak task persistence.

## 2. Stimulant Medications

| Drug Class            | Examples             | Mechanism                                      | Neurotransmitters         | Duration (XR) |
| --------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------- |
| **Methylphenidate**   | Concerta, Ritalin LA | Blocks reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine | Dopamine + Norepinephrine | 8–12 hrs      |
| **Amphetamine salts** | Adderall XR, Vyvanse | Promotes release + blocks reuptake             | Dopamine + Norepinephrine | 10–12 hrs     |

**Key difference:**

* Methylphenidate = reuptake blocker only.
* Amphetamine = releaser + reuptake blocker → stronger effect.

### Purpose

* Increase dopamine and norepinephrine in synapses → stronger signal transmission.
* Improve attention, reduce impulsivity, enhance motivation.

### Why Long-Release Forms Exist

* Controlled release → smoother levels, fewer crashes, lower misuse risk.

## 3. Neurochemical Signaling 101

1. Neuron fires → releases neurotransmitters into the **synaptic cleft**.
2. Receptors on the next neuron detect them → transmit signal.
3. Neurotransmitters are then **reabsorbed (reuptake)** or **broken down**.

Blocking reuptake keeps dopamine/norepinephrine longer in the cleft → **stronger, clearer signaling**.

Too little signaling = distracted.
Too much signaling = anxiety, overstimulation.
Optimal signaling = calm, focused control.

## 4. The Inverted-U Curve

Performance follows an inverted-U relation to dopamine/norepinephrine:

* Too little → weak, unfocused.
* Moderate → optimal focus.
* Too much → anxious, impulsive.

Stimulants aim to lift neurotransmitter levels into that middle zone.

## 5. Brain Circuits Involved

| Circuit                          | Function                             | Main Neurotransmitter     | Effect of Stimulants                |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Prefrontal Cortex (PFC)**      | Planning, attention, impulse control | Dopamine + Norepinephrine | Improves working memory and control |
| **Striatum / Nucleus Accumbens** | Motivation, reward                   | Dopamine                  | Increases drive and task initiation |

* **ADHD = low dopamine in both areas.**
* **Stimulants normalize:**

  * PFC → focus and control
  * Striatum → motivation and reward

Too high a dose overstimulates the reward circuit → anxiety, irritability, poor focus.

## 6. Dopamine vs. Norepinephrine Roles

| Feature        | Dopamine                      | Norepinephrine                 |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Role**       | Motivation, reward, salience  | Alertness, sustained attention |
| **Too little** | Boredom, low drive            | Mental fog, inattention        |
| **Too much**   | Impulsivity, compulsive focus | Anxiety, hypervigilance        |

They balance each other:

* Dopamine decides *what's worth attention*.
* Norepinephrine sustains attention on it.

---

## 7. Within the Prefrontal Cortex

* **Dopamine** = filter. Moderate levels sharpen relevant signals.
* **Norepinephrine** = gain control. Keeps circuits alert but not overactive.

Together they stabilize working memory and inhibition.
Too little of either = scattered mind. Too much = anxious rigidity.

---

## 8. Nicotine and ADHD

### Mechanism

* Acts on **nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs)**.
* Indirectly boosts dopamine and norepinephrine → brief stimulant-like clarity.

### Shortcomings

* Effects last minutes → rebound cravings.
* Receptor desensitization → tolerance.
* Worsens dopamine deficits when off nicotine.

### ADHD Link

* ADHD increases likelihood of nicotine use (~2–3×).
* Nicotine acts as self-medication for low dopamine tone.
* Harder to quit due to withdrawal-induced cognitive dullness.

### Offsetting Withdrawal

* Exercise, sunlight, sleep, protein (tyrosine → dopamine).
* Structured stimulation (cold, challenges).
* Temporary pharmacological support (e.g., bupropion, atomoxetine).

## 9. Non-Stimulant ADHD Medications

| Drug                             | Mechanism                                    | Effect                          | Onset      | Key Use                                 |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Atomoxetine (Strattera)**      | Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor            | Smooth focus, less impulsivity  | 2–6 weeks  | Non-addictive, steady tone              |
| **Bupropion (Wellbutrin/Zyban)** | Dopamine + norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor | Energizing, helps quit nicotine | Days–weeks | ADHD with depression or smoking         |
| **Guanfacine / Clonidine**       | Alpha-2A receptor agonists                   | Calm, reduce hyperactivity      | Weeks      | Impulsivity, sleep aid, adjunct therapy |

**Summary:**

* Atomoxetine = steady focus.
* Bupropion = motivation and energy.
* Guanfacine/Clonidine = emotional regulation and calm.

## 10. Big Picture

* ADHD is not lack of willpower but **inefficient chemical signaling** in control and reward circuits.
* Stimulants correct signal strength; non-stimulants smooth regulation.
* The goal: reach the middle of the inverted-U—alert, calm, motivated.

> *"ADHD medication doesn't add skills you don't have. It gives your brain a fair chance to use the ones you already do."*
