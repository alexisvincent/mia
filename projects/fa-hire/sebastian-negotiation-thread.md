Hi Lex,

all good.

Maybe just for calibration - currently I make about 6100€ net per month, with no extra equity etc on top.
Not exactly sure how all the tax and social contributions would change depending on the setup, that's why I'm going with net as the number I'm looking to optimise.

Thanks for the link, I'll have a look!

Best,
Sebastian

Hi Sebastian,

Thanks for the quick response. Got feedback from Daniel just now. Sorry for the delay here.

To give you some context, we were initially aiming for around €80k gross for this role. Your current comp would make you our second highest paid after our lead engineer (above me and the other engineers). I'm definitely considering it, but wanted to share that context and see if you have any flexibility on the net optimization side?

Also need to understand which country you're planning to be tax resident in. If you're considering Portugal, there's actually a pretty interesting opportunity - their new IFICI program gives you a 20% flat tax for 10 years if you qualify (which you likely would). We could potentially set up a Portuguese entity to employ you, which might help bridge any gap through tax efficiency.

Otherwise do you have any other ideas on tax residency? What are your plans.

Should be able to settle offer without further delay from others now that I've gotten feedback, sorry again!

Best,
Lex

Hi Lex,

thanks for getting back!

My plans would indeed be to become a tax resident in Portugal - if we can make use of the program that would be a great way to bridge the gap in comp expectations.

I think we discussed starting date last time, right? I'm available from September 1st.

Best,
Sebastian

## Final Response (July 10, 2025)

**Subject**: Re: Compensation and structure options

Hi Sebastian,

Excellent - Portugal it is! The IFICI program will work perfectly for bridging the compensation gap given a flat 20%.

Here's our formal offer:

**Starting Base Salary**: $80,000 USD (~€68,520)
**Post-Seed Base Salary**: $110,000 USD (~€94,420) once we close our seed (targeting end of this year)
**Equity**: 1.5% with 1-year cliff and 4-year vesting
**Start Date**: September 1st works perfectly
**Structure**: We'll set up the Portuguese entity to employ you under IFICI, giving you the 20% flat tax rate.
**Net Expectations**: At 20% flat tax, you'd be looking at approximately €54,820 net starting, rising to €75,540 net post-seed.

The offer is effectively to match your current cash comp, but we'd find it difficult to do that before we have our seed round in the bag. So the ask is whether you'd accept a lower salary while we work to close that round, with solid equity compensation (our current seed target valuation is north of $50M) to make up for it. We'd really love to have you on board the team - we think it's going to be a lot of fun and we're pretty sure we have a winner.

Let me know.

Best,
Lex
