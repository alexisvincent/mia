Tax-Efficient Hiring in Portugal: NHR Replacement (IFICI) and Eligibility

Scenario: You want to hire a German national as a Founder’s Associate (executive assistant/chief-of-staff role) who will spend most of their time in Portugal. Both you and the candidate seek a tax-efficient employment solution. Portugal’s well-known Non-Habitual Resident (NHR) tax regime (popular among expats) has been discontinued for new applicants as of 1 January 2024 ￼. However, it has been replaced by a new incentive program. Below, we explain the new regime, its benefits, and assess whether it can apply to your candidate.

End of NHR and Introduction of IFICI (NHR 2.0)

Portugal ended the NHR special tax regime in 2024, but simultaneously introduced the “Tax Incentive for Scientific Research and Innovation” (Incentivo Fiscal à Investigação Científica e Inovação, IFICI). This is informally referred to as “NHR 2.0.” It aims to attract and retain highly qualified professionals in fields like technology, scientific research, innovation, and business development ￼. In essence, IFICI offers similar tax benefits to the old NHR, including a flat 20% income tax rate on qualifying employment or self-employment income (instead of Portugal’s usual progressive rates that go up to ~48-53%) and exemptions for most foreign-sourced income ￼. These benefits are granted for up to 10 years for those who newly relocate to Portugal under the program ￼.

Key benefits of IFICI:
	•	Flat 20% Tax on Portuguese Earnings: If the individual’s job qualifies under the scheme, any Portuguese-source salary or self-employment income is taxed at 20% flat (for comparison, a €100k salary normally falls in the top bracket ~45-48% plus solidarity surtax). This 20% flat rate applies for 10 consecutive years after relocating ￼. For example, a €100k salary would incur roughly €20k income tax under IFICI, versus perhaps ~€40-45k under standard rates – a significant saving.
	•	Foreign Income Largely Exempt: Most categories of foreign-sourced income are tax-exempt in Portugal under IFICI (with some conditions). Dividends, interest, capital gains, rental income, etc., from abroad are exempt from Portuguese tax as long as they come from a country with a tax treaty or equivalent (and not a blacklisted tax haven) ￼. Exception: foreign pension income does not get an exemption under the new scheme (unlike old NHR) and is taxed normally, but this likely isn’t relevant for your candidate ￼ ￼.
	•	Duration: The favorable tax treatment lasts 10 years (non-renewable) from the year the person becomes a Portuguese tax resident under the scheme ￼. After 10 years, they revert to the regular tax regime.
	•	No Minimum Stay Requirement: Similar to NHR, there is no strict day-count stay requirement each year (aside from meeting the basic tax residency definition). The individual simply must be tax resident in Portugal in a given year to use the regime for that year ￼ ￼.
	•	Social Security: The IFICI regime does not waive social security obligations. The person (or employer) still pays Portuguese social security contributions on salary as usual ￼ ￼. The benefit mainly concerns income tax.

Eligibility Criteria for IFICI

To qualify for IFICI (NHR 2.0), an individual and their employment must meet several conditions:
	•	New Tax Resident: The person must become a Portuguese tax resident on or after 1 January 2024, having not been tax resident in Portugal in the previous 5 years ￼. (A German citizen moving in 2025 would satisfy this, assuming they haven’t lived in Portugal before.)
	•	Highly-Qualified Role or Sector: The individual must work in a qualifying professional activity or role, generally in the realm of science, technology, higher education, or other high-value industries. The law defines specific categories of eligible work. Examples include:
	•	Scientific/Academic roles: University professors, researchers, scientists ￼.
	•	Technical/Professional roles: Doctors, engineers, IT and ICT specialists, specialists in mathematics or physical sciences ￼.
	•	Senior business roles: Company directors, CEOs, executive managers, and managers of administration or commercial areas ￼. (Notably, “directors of companies (board members, CEOs, executive managers)” are explicitly listed as highly qualified professionals under IFICI ￼.)
	•	Innovation & High-Value Industries: Professionals in information technology, high-tech R&D, audiovisual/media production, energy, environment, telecommunications, tourism of strategic interest, agriculture and other productive industries are included ￼. Shared services center professionals and certain manufacturing or extractive industry specialists also qualify ￼.
	•	Qualified Employer/Entity: Alternatively (or additionally), the employing company or entity can qualify the individual by its nature. The IFICI regime targets not just certain professions but also people working in approved companies or sectors. For example, eligibility extends to:
	•	Certified Innovative Startups: “Directors/employees of accredited Portuguese startups” can qualify under IFICI ￼. In other words, if the person works for a startup company officially recognized (certified) as an innovative startup in Portugal, they are eligible even if their specific job title isn’t on a predefined list. (More on this below – this route is likely very relevant to your hire.)
	•	Export-Focused Companies: Employees in companies that export at least 50% of their turnover (in certain industries) can qualify, as these are considered crucial to the national economy ￼ ￼. (This is typically for industrial or tech companies with significant export sales.)
	•	Investments and R&D Centers: People working in entities that have investment contracts or R&D projects recognized by the government (via agencies like AICEP or IAPMEI) can qualify ￼. Likewise, researchers involved in certified R&D projects or those working in Portugal’s scientific and tech innovation hubs may qualify.
	•	Educational/Experience Requirement: Unlike the old NHR, the new IFICI has a skills threshold. The individual should typically have a higher education degree and/or significant experience in their field. Specifically, applicants are expected to have at least an EQF level 6 qualification (Bachelor’s degree) plus 3+ years of professional experience; or a Doctorate (PhD, EQF level 8) (which waives the work experience requirement) ￼. This is to ensure the tax break is given to “highly qualified” personnel. (In practice, a Founder’s Associate with a university degree and a few years of relevant experience would likely meet this criterion.)
	•	No Previous NHR/Ex-Residente usage: The person must not have been a beneficiary of the old NHR regime before, and not have used Portugal’s “former resident” tax program (usually for returning Portuguese expats) ￼. (As your candidate is German and presumably never had NHR, this condition is satisfied.)

Finally, to actually obtain IFICI status, the individual must apply to the Portuguese tax authorities (and relevant certifying bodies) after moving. The application involves proving they and their job meet the above criteria. There is a firm deadline (generally January 15 of the year after you become resident) to submit the IFICI registration ￼. Required documents include things like proof of academic qualifications, a copy of the employment contract, an official company registration certificate, and a statement from the employer confirming that the role and company fulfill the IFICI activity requirements ￼. Approval is not automatic; authorities will verify eligibility more rigorously than under the old NHR ￼ ￼.

“Certified Startup” Route and Tax Incentives

Given the candidate’s startup-oriented role, a crucial aspect is the “certified startup” category under IFICI. The new regime explicitly includes employees or board members of startups certified under Portuguese law as eligible ￼. In practice, this means if your company (or a local entity thereof) can be recognized as a qualifying startup in Portugal, the Founder’s Associate would likely fall under the incentive.
	•	What counts as a certified startup? Generally, a startup must meet criteria such as being less than 10 years old, having under 250 employees, and annual turnover under €50 million – basically a small, young company ￼. It also must be an innovative or high-growth business. Portugal requires startups to be “recognized as innovative” (for example, developing new products/technology or having secured venture investment). If a company isn’t automatically covered, it can seek an official Startup Certification from Startup Portugal (a government-associated body) by demonstrating an innovative business model or high growth potential ￼. Once this status is obtained (a process done via the gov.pt portal ￼), the company is an “accredited startup.” Employees and executives working there can then use the IFICI tax scheme.
	•	Competent Authority: Applications under the startup route are reviewed in coordination with Startup Portugal. In other words, the tax authority will likely require Startup Portugal’s sign-off that the employer is a certified startup when approving the IFICI status ￼.
	•	Relevance to your case: If your U.S./UK startup has a presence in Portugal or is willing to establish one, it could pursue this certification. For example, you might set up a Portuguese subsidiary or branch of the company (meeting the above criteria) and have that entity employ the candidate. As long as the Portuguese entity is recognized as a startup, the Founder’s Associate (as an employee of a certified startup) squarely fits an IFICI-eligible category ￼. Even if their role is more managerial/operational than technical, it’s the company’s innovative/startup status that matters in this route.
Note: If you do not set up a local company, employing the person directly from abroad (e.g. via the UK subsidiary or an Employer-of-Record) might not automatically qualify for IFICI. The tax incentive is meant for work performed in Portugal in eligible sectors/entities. In fact, guidance indicates that a self-employed person contracting solely with a foreign company would not qualify – the services generally need to be provided to a Portuguese entity or within Portugal’s scope of economic activity to get IFICI treatment ￼. So, using a local employer (or entity) is advisable to securely fall under the regime’s letter. An EOR in Portugal could handle payroll and compliance, but you’d still want to ensure the role is defined such that it meets the innovation/startup criteria (the EOR could, for instance, state the employee is seconded to your startup company). The cleaner approach, if feasible, is a dedicated Portuguese entity for your startup.

Applicability to the German Founder’s Associate

Based on the research, it appears very likely that the new IFICI tax incentive could apply to your candidate, provided you structure the employment appropriately:
	•	Meets Personal Criteria: The candidate is German (EU citizen) moving to Portugal, so they can easily become a resident. They have not been a Portuguese resident in the last 5 years (presumably never), and have never used NHR. This satisfies the basic personal eligibility ￼.
	•	Nature of the Role: A Founder’s Associate is a versatile, high-responsibility role in a startup – essentially “halfway between an executive assistant and a chief of staff.” In practice, this often involves strategic projects, operations, and business development tasks for the founder. We can argue that this role is part of the executive management of a company, which is one of the qualifying professional categories (company directors/executive managers) under IFICI ￼. If the person’s title or job description can be framed as an executive managerial position in a tech/innovation-driven business, it strengthens the case. Notably, general and executive managers in innovative sectors are explicitly listed as eligible professionals ￼. So, from a professional activity standpoint, the role can qualify as “high value-added.”
	•	Company Qualification: Crucially, if your startup is positioned as a tech or innovation-driven company, having the candidate work for a Portuguese-certified startup entity would directly qualify them for the 20% tax rate ￼. For instance, if your main company sets up a small Portuguese subsidiary (meeting the <10-year, <250 employee criteria) or if the individual establishes a new Portuguese company that functions as a local branch of your startup, that entity can seek certification as a startup. The Founder’s Associate would then be an employee of a certified startup – making them eligible under IFICI by virtue of that status ￼. Given that your company is a startup (with a U.S. base and a UK subsidiary), it likely fits the profile (small, recently founded, innovation-oriented). It may need to apply for official startup recognition in Portugal, but this is a known process (handled via Startup Portugal) and is achievable if the business is indeed innovative/high-growth ￼.
	•	Salary Level: There is no salary cap or minimum for IFICI, but a €100k/year salary is well within reasonable range for a “highly qualified” professional. If anything, a solid salary supports the notion that this is a senior, valuable role. Under IFICI, that €100k would be taxed at 20% (~€20k tax), instead of progressive rates (which would likely impose ~40-45% tax or more on the top portions of that income under normal rules).
	•	Documentation: The candidate should be prepared to show proof of their qualifications – e.g., a university degree diploma and CV to demonstrate a few years of professional experience. The company (or EOR) will need to provide an employment contract and a letter confirming that the job and company meet the IFICI criteria (e.g. stating that the individual will be working in an innovation-focused role at an innovative startup) ￼. Also, the Portuguese company’s registration details or certification will be needed. Since your startup is foreign, creating a local entity or partnership with an incubator might be necessary to get that documentation. Once the pieces are in place, the application for IFICI would be filed shortly after the individual becomes a resident (by January 15 of the following year, at the latest).
	•	Outcome: If approved, the Founder’s Associate would enjoy the 20% flat tax rate on their employment income for 10 years, and they’d pay no Portuguese tax on any foreign passive income they might have (interest, dividends, etc.), which is a very favorable setup ￼. This achieves the tax optimization both you and the candidate are looking for, making Portugal a viable base from a tax standpoint. It keeps the effective tax on their compensation low (comparable to or better than many other jurisdictions for that income level).

In summary, Portugal’s new IFICI regime appears to be a strong fit for your situation assuming the role and company are structured to meet the eligibility requirements. The candidate’s profile (German expat, working in a startup at a managerial level) is precisely the type of scenario Portugal is targeting with this incentive ￼ ￼. By ensuring the person is employed through a qualifying Portuguese startup entity (which may involve incorporating or certifying your startup locally) ￼, you can likely secure the 20% flat tax for their income ￼. This would be far more tax-efficient than hiring them without such a scheme (where they’d otherwise pay ordinary Portuguese taxes on a ~€100k salary). Both the company and the candidate should benefit: the candidate keeps more of their net pay (making the offer attractive), and the company can legitimately employ them in Portugal without incurring exorbitant tax cost.

Do note that the IFICI application process is more stringent now than NHR was – it requires timely application and proper evidence ￼ ￼. It would be wise to consult a Portuguese tax advisor or global mobility specialist to assist with the startup certification and IFICI registration. But based on the research, yes, the new tax incentive scheme could very well apply to this person – enabling a tax-efficient hire in Portugal under the new rules.
