Hi Lex,

all good.

Maybe just for calibration - currently I make about 6100€ net per month, with no extra equity etc on top.
Not exactly sure how all the tax and social contributions would change depending on the setup, that's why I'm going with net as the number I'm looking to optimise.

Thanks for the link, I'll have a look!

Best,
Sebastian

## Compensation Analysis

### Current Compensation (Germany)
- **Net Salary**: €6,100/month (€73,200/year)
- **Estimated Gross**: €110,000-€115,000 annually
- **UK Equivalent**: £92,000-£96,000 gross
- **No Equity**: Currently receives no equity compensation

### Market Gap Analysis
- **London FA Market**: £55,000-£70,000 (our target range)
- **Sebastian's Current**: £92,000-£96,000 equivalent
- **Compensation Gap**: ~£25,000-£40,000 difference
- **Challenge**: Significant salary reduction for role transition

### Offer Strategy Considerations
1. **Base Salary**: May need to exceed market range to attract
2. **Equity Component**: 0.5% starting equity as value-add
3. **Career Progression**: Emphasize CoS pathway (£70K-£100K)
4. **Total Package**: Focus on long-term value proposition
5. **Non-Monetary**: London experience, startup growth potential

### Negotiation Notes
- Sebastian optimizing for net salary (tax efficiency focus)
- Currently no equity upside in German role
- May need creative package structure to bridge gap
- Consider higher starting equity (0.75-1%) to offset base salary gap
- Emphasize career acceleration and skill development

### Portugal IFICI Option
- Portugal IFICI (NHR 2.0) available: 20% flat tax for 10 years
- Would require setting up Portuguese entity for compliance
- Sebastian would be responsible for local entity setup/management
- Potential €20-25k annual tax savings vs Germany
- Alternative to UK location with significant tax advantages

## Notes
- Sebastian is optimizing for net salary due to tax/social contribution uncertainties
- No current equity compensation
- Significant compensation gap presents negotiation challenge
- May require above-market offer or creative package structure
- Focus on total value proposition and career growth opportunity
- Additional context and details to be added as the hiring process progresses
- All sensitive information should be handled with appropriate confidentiality
